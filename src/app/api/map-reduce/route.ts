  "that's a good point no no it's a good point now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on one of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say normal say this all over and over and over again I only deal in facts I don't deal in hypotheticals I only deal in facts I only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally to the particular Point you're trying to push the idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition I don't think you understand politics they forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe Shores in Palestine that's what they did and they knew that the Jew were being persecuted in Europe Palestine the only spot of land on Earth yes basically that was the problem the Jews couldn't immigrate about your great friends in Britain The Architects of of the Bal for declar by the late 1930 about the United States W happy to take in Jews and the Americans W happy why and why are Palestinians who were not Europeans who had zero role in the rise of Nazism who had no relation to any of this why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe and un only safe haven for Jews Professor Morris because of your logic and I'm not disputing it that's why October 7th happened oh my God because there was no options left for those people the Kamas guys who attacked the Kim they apart from the attacks on the military sites when they attacked the kibuts were out to kill civilians and they killed family after family house after house talk fast so people think that you're coherent I'm just reading from the UN I know you like them sometimes only when they agree with you though you've lied about this particular instance in the past those kids weren't just on the beach as as often stated articles those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that they had operated from they liter belli with all due respect with all due respect you're such a fantastic it's terrifying the following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine with Norman fenin Benny Morris mu Rabani and Steven benell also known online as Destiny Norman many are historians muen is a Middle East analyst and Steven is a political commentator and streamer all four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic the goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points it wasn't to get views or likes I never care about those and I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care the goal was to explore together the history present and future of Israel and Palestine in a free flowing conversation no time limits no rules there was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning and it only got more intense as we went along and I quickly realized that this very conversation in a very real human way was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of Israel and Palestine for some debates I will St step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling for this I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges because that emotion in itself spoke volumes we did talk about the history and the future but the anger the frustration the biting wit and at times respect and camaraderie were all there like I said we did it in an perhaps all to human way I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics and I will continue to search for Hope in the midst of death and destruction to search for our our common Humanity in the midst of division and hate this thing we have going on human civilization the whole of it is beautiful and it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together I love you all this is Alex Freedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Norman felstein Benny Morris muan Rabani and Steven benell first question is about 1948 for Israelis 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the war of independence for Palestinians 1948 is the nakba which means catastrophe or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from their home hes as a consequence of the war what to you is important to understand about the events of 1948 and the period around there 47 49 that helps us understand what's going on today and uh maybe helps us understand the roots of all this that started even before 1948 I was hoping that Norm can speak first and Benny then M and then Norm after World War II the British decid that they didn't want to deal with the Palestine question anymore and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations now as I read the record the UN was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate Rights and Wrongs it was confronting a very practical problem there were two national communities in Palestine and there were irreconcilable differences on fundamental questions most importantly looking at the historic record on the question of immigration and associate with the question of immigration the question of lend the UN special committee on Palestine which came into being before the UN 181 partition resolution the UN special committee it recommended two states in Palestine there was a minority position represented by uh Iran India Yugoslavia they supported one state but uh they believed that if forced to the two communities would figure out some sort of modus sendi and live together the United Nations General Assembly supported partition between what it called a Jewish State and an Arab State now in my reading of the record and they understand there's new scholarship in the subject which I've not read but so far as I've read the record there's no Clarity on what the United Nations General said assembly meant by a Jewish State and an Arab State except for the fact that the Jewish state would be demographically the majority would be Jewish and the Arab state demographically would be Arab the unscop the UN special committee on Palestine it was very clear and it was re reiterated many times that in recommending two states each state the Arab State and the Jewish state would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens with regard to political civil and religious matters now that does raise the question if there is absolute full equality of all citizens both in the Jewish state and the Arab state with regard to political rights civil rights and religious rights apart from the demographic majority it's very unclear what it meant to call a state Jewish or call the state Arab in my view the partition resolution was the correct decision I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities could at that point be made to live together I disagree with the minority position of India Iran and Yugoslavia and that not being a practical option two states was the only other option in this regard I would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech at the UN General Assembly proceedings by the Soviet foreign minister gromo I was very tempted to quote it at length but I recognized that would be uh taking too much time uh so I asked a young friend Jamie Stern Wier to edit it and just get the essence of what foreign minister gromo had to say during the last war gromo said the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering without any exaggeration this sorrow and suffering are Indescribable hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about in various countries of Europe in search of means of existence and in search of shelter the United Nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference past experience particularly during the second world war shows that no Western European state was able to provide adequate assistance for the Jewish people in defending its rights and its very existence from the violence of the Hitler ites and their allies this is an unpleasant fact but unfortunately like all other facts it must be admitted gromo went on to say in principle he supports one state or the Soviet Union supports one state but he said if relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine proved to be so bad that would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the Arabs and the Jews the Soviet Union would support two states I personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable in the long term if and this is a big if the Zionist movement had been faithful to the position it proclaimed during the unscop public hearings at the time benorian testified quote I want to express what we mean by a Jewish state we mean by a Jewish State simply a state where the majority of the people are Jews not a state where a Jew has in any way any privilege more than anyone else a Jewish State means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on Democracy alas the this was not to be as Professor Mars has written quote Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist and then he wrote in another book transfer the euphemism for exposion transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism because it sought to transform a land which was Arab into a Jewish State and a Jewish State could not have Arisen without a major displacement of Arab population and because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs which in turn persuade the yeshua's leaders the yeshu being the Jewish Community the yeshua's leaders that a hostile Arab majority or large minority could not remain in place if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure or as Professor Mars retrospectively Put it quote a removing of a population was needed without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established unquote the Arab site rejected outright the partition resolution I won't play games with that I know a lot of people try to prove it's not true it clearly in my view is true the Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution while Israel early leaders acting under compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism found the pretext in the course of the first Arab Israeli War to expel the indigenous population and expand its borders I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it thank you Norm nor asked that you make a lengthy statement in the beginning uh Benny I hope it's okay to call Everybody by their first name in the name of camaraderie Norm has quoted several things you said uh perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of 1948 and maybe respond to the things that Norm said yeah unscop the United Nations special committee on Palestine um recommended partition the majority of uncope recommended partition which was accepted by the UN General Assembly in November 1947 essentially looking back to the peel Commission in 1937 10 years earlier a British commission had looked at the problem of Palestine the two Waring National groups who refus to live together if you like or um consolidate a a unitary state state between them and and Peele said there should be two states that's the principle The Country Must Be partitioned into two states this would give a modicum of Justice to both sides if not all their demands of course um and the United Nations followed suit the United Nations unop and then the UN General Assembly representing the will of the International Community um said two states is the just solution in this complex situation the problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution the Arabs the Arab states and the Arabs of Palestine said no as Norman frl Stein said they said no they rejected the partition idea the principle of partition not just the idea of what percentage which side should get but the principle of partition they said no to the Jews should not have any part of Palestine for their Sovereign territory maybe Jews could live as a minority in Palestine that also was problematic in the eyes of the the Palestinian Arab leadership husseini had said only Jews who were there before 1917 could actually get citizenship and continue to live there but the Arabs rejected partition and the Arabs of Palestine launched in very disorganized fashion war against the resolution against the implementation of the resolution against the Jewish community in Palestine um and this was their defeat in that civil war between the two communities while the British were withdrawing from Palestine um led to the Arab Invasion the The Invasion by the Arab states in May 1948 of of the country again basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state in line with the United Nations um decision and the will of the International Community Norman said that the Zionist Enterprise and he quoted me meant from the beginning um to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine or some of the Arabs of Palestine um and I think he's sort of um quoting out of context the context in which the statements were made that that um the Jewish State could only emerge um if there was a transfer of Arab population was preceded in the way I wrote it and the way it actually happened by Arab resistance and hostilities towards the Jewish Community had the Arabs accepted partition there would have been a large Arab minority in the Jewish state which emerged in 447 and in fact Jewish um economists and state Builders took into account that there would be a large Arab minority and its needs would be cared for ETC um but this was not to be because the Arabs attacked and had they not attacked um perhaps a a a Jewish state with a large Arab minority could have emerged but this didn't happen they went to war the Jews resisted and in the course of that war um Arab populations were driven out some were expelled some left because Arab leaders advised them to leave or ordered them to leave and at the end of the war Israel said they can't return because they just tried to destroy the Jewish State um and and that's the basic reality of what happened in 48 the Jews created a state the Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to create a state a before 48 and in the course of the 1948 war and for that reason they have no state to this day the Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state fought for it and um established it um hopefully lastingly when you said hostility in case people are not familiar there was a fullon war where Arab States invaded and Israel won that war let me just add to clarify the the war had two parts to it the first part was the Arab community in Palestine its militia men attacked the Jews um a from November 1947 in other words from the day after the UN partition resolution it was passed Arab gunmen were busy shooting up Jews and that snowballed into a fullscale civil war between the two communities in Palestine in May 1948 a second stage began in the war in which the Arab States invaded the new state attacked the new state um and and they too were defeated and thus in the state of Israel emerged in the course of this two-stage War a a vast Palestinian refugee problem um um occurred and so after that the transfer the expulsion the the thing that people call the nakba uh happened um will could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it sure um there's there's a lot to unpack here I'll try to limit myself to just a few points regarding Zionism and transfer I think himim whitesman uh the head of the world Zionist organization had it exactly right when he said that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine as Jewish as England is English or France is French um in other words um as as Norman explains um a Jewish State requires Jewish political demographic and territorial Supremacy without those three elements um the state would be Jewish in name only and I think what distinguishes Zionism is its insistence Supremacy and exclusivity that would be my first point second point is um I think what the Soviet foreign minister at the time Andre gromo said is exactly right with one reservation um gomo was describing a European savagery Unleashed against Europe's Jews at the time you know it wasn't Palestinians or Arabs uh the Savages and The Barbarians were European to the core um it had nothing to do with development in Palestine um uh or the Middle East secondly at the time that groma was speaking um those Jewish uh survivors of the Holocaust and and others who were in need of Safe Haven were still overwhelmingly on the European continent and not on Palestine not in Palestine and I think um given um the scale of the savagery I don't think that any one state or country um should have borne the responsibility uh for addressing this crisis I think it should have been an international uh responsibility um the Soviet Union could have contributed Germany certainly could and should have uh contributed um the United Kingdom and the United States uh which slammed their doors shut to um uh the persecuted Jews of Europe as the Nazis were rising to power they certainly should have uh played a role but instead what passed for the International Community at the time decided to partition Palestine and here I think we need to um uh judge the partition resolution against the realities that obtained at the time um two 2third of the population of Palestine was Arab uh the yeshu the Jewish community in Palestine constituted about onethird of the total population and controlled even less of um of of the land uh within Palestine as as a preeminent Palestinian historian uh W Al khi has pointed out the partition resolution in giving roughly 55% of Palestine to the Jewish Community um and I I think 41 42% uh to the Arab Community to the Palestinians did not preserve the position of each Community or even um uh favor one community at the expense of the others rather it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized uh the relationship uh between between the two communities and as many have written the the neba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature of Zionism um given the territorial disposition given the weakness of the Palestinian Community whose leadership had been largely de uh decimated during a major Revolt at the end of the 1930s um given that the Arab states uh were still very much under French and British influence um uh the neba was was um inevitable the inevitable product of the um partition uh resolution and and one last point also about um the the un's partition resolution is yes um formally that is what the International Community decided in on the 29th of November 1947 it's not a resolution that could ever have gotten through the UN General Assembly today for a very simple reason it was a very different General Assembly most African most Asian States um were not yet independent um were the resolution to be placed before the International Community today and I find it telling that um uh the minority opinion was led by India Iran and Yugoslavia I think they would have represented the clear um uh majority so partition given what we know about Zionism given that it was was entirely predictable what would happen given um uh the realities on the ground in Palestine um was deeply unjust and the idea that either the Palestinians or the Arab states could have accepted um such a resolution is is I think um uh an illusion that was in 1947 we saw what happened in 48 and 49 Palestinian Society was essentially um uh destroyed over 80% I believe of Palestinians resident in the territory that became the state of Israel were either expelled or fled uh and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because ethnic cleansing consists of two components it's not just forcing people into Refuge or expelling them it's just as importantly preventing their return and here and and and beny Morris has written I think an article about ysph vites and the transfer committees um there was a very detailed initiative to prevent their return and it consisted of raising hundreds of Palestinian villages to the ground which was systematically implemented and so on and so Palestinians became a stateless people now um what is the most important reason that no Arab state was established um in Palestine well since the 1930s um the Zionist leadership and um the hashm might um uh leadership of uh Jordan as has been uh thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli British historian aiim essentially colluded um to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab State um in Palestine uh in the late 1940s um there's there's much more here but I think um those those are the key points I I would make about uh 1948 we may talk about Zionism Britain y assemblies and all all the things you mentioned there's a lot to dig into so again if you can keep it to just one statement moving forward after Sten if you want to go a little longer uh also we should acknowledge the fact that the speaking speeds of of people here are different Stephen speaks about 10 times faster uh than me uh Stephen do you want to comment on 1948 yeah I think it's interesting where people choose to start the history um I noticed a lot of people like to start at either 47 or 48 because it's the first time where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side that they want to ascribe 100% of the blame to the newly emergent Israeli state to uh but I feel like when you have this type of reading of History it feels like the goal is to moralize everything first and then to pick and choose facts that kind of support the statements of your initial moral statement afterwards um whenever people are talking about 48 or the establishment of the Arab State uh I never hear about uh the fact that a Civil War started in 47 uh that was largely instigated because of the Arab rejectionism of the 47 partition plan uh I never hear about the fact that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by purchases from Jewish organizations of uh Palestinian Arabs of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory period in 1920 even started um funnily enough King Abdullah of Jordan uh was quoted as saying the Arabs are as prodical in selling their land as they are in Weeping about it uh I never hear about the multiple times that Arabs rejected partition uh rejected living with Jews um rejected any sort of state that would have even uh had any sort of Jewish exclusivity it's funny because it was brought up before that the partition plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs rejected it as though they rejected it because it was unfair because of the amount of land that Jews were given and not just due to the fact that Jews were given land at all as though a 30% partition or 25% partition would have been accepted when I don't think that was the reality of the circumstances I feel like most of the other stuff has been said but I I I noticed that um whenever people talk about 48 or the years preceding 48 um I think the worst thing that happens is there's a there's a cherry picking of the facts where basically all of the blame is ascribed to this uh this built-in idea of Zionism that because of a handful of quotes or because of an ideology we can say that transfer or population exposion or the the basically the Mandate of all of these Arabs being kicked off the land was always going to happen when I think there's a refusal sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the Zionist leaders there is a political social and Military reality on the ground that they're forced to contend with and unfortunately the Arabs because of their inability to engage in diplomacy and only to use tools of War to try to negotiate everything going on in mandatory Palestine basically always gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way uh because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else whether it was the partition plan in 47 whether it was the uh the Lucan peace conference afterwards where Israel even offered to Annex Gaza in 51 where they offered to take in 100,000 refugees every single deal is just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don't want a Jewish State anywhere in this region of the world I would like to engage Professor Morris if you don't mind I'm not with the first name it's just not my way of relating you can just call me Morris you don't need the professor okay there's a real problem here and it's been the problem I've had over many years of reading your work apart perhaps from as grandchild I suspect nobody knows your work better than I do I've read it many times not once not twice at least three times everything you've written and the problem is it's a kind of quicksilver you very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it so we're going to try here to to see whether we can hold you to a point and then you argue with me the point I have no problem with that uh your name please Sten banel okay Mr banel referred to cherry-picking and handful of quotes now it's true that when you wrote your first book on the Palestinian refugee question you only had a few lines on this issue of transfer four pages yeah in the first book in the first book four pages maybe before you know I'm not going to quarrel my memory is not clear we're talking about 40 years ago I read it I read it but then I read other things by you okay and you were taken to task of my memories correct that you hadn't adequately documented the claims of transfer let me allow me to finish and I thought that was a reasonable challenge because it was an unusual usual claim for a mainstream Israeli historian to say as you did in that first book that from the very beginning transfer figured prominently in Zionist thinking that wasn't unusual if you read Anita shapira shapira you read chapai heit that was an unusual acknowledgement by you and then I found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book you devoted 25 pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer in Zionist thinking and in fact you used a very provocative and resonant phrase you said that transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism we're not talking about circumstantial factors a war Arab hostility you said it's inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism now as I said so we won't be accused of cherry-picking those were 25 very densely argued pages and then in an interview and I could cite several quotes but I'll choose one you said removing a population was needed let's look at the words without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established now you were the one again I was very surprised when I read your book here I'm referring to righteous victims I was very surprised when I came to that page 37 where you wrote that territorial displacement and dispossession was the CH Chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism territorial displacement and dispossession were the chief motor of Arab resistance Des Zionism so you then went on to say because the Arab population rationally feared territorial displacement and dispossession it of course opposed Zionism that say normal as Native Americans opposing the euroamerican Manifest Destiny in the history of our own country because they understood it would be at their expense it was inbuilt and inevitable and so now for you to come along and say that it all happened just because of the war that otherwise the zionists made all these plans for a happy minority to live there that simply does not gel it does not cohere it is not reconcilable with what you yourself have written it was inevitable and inbuilt now in other situations you've said that's true but I think it was a greater good to establish a Jewish State at the expense of the uh indigenous population that's another kind of argument that was Theodore Roosevelt's argument in our own country he said we don't want the whole of North America to remain a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teps we have to get rid of them and make this a great country but he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable I think you've made your point first I'll take up something that mu said he said that the nakba was inevitable as have you and predictable no no no I I've never said that it was inevitable and predictable only because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community and state in 1947 48 had there been no assault there probably wouldn't have been a refugee problem there's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred expulsions to have occurred a dispossession massive dispossession to occur these occurred as a result of War now Norman said that I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism in one way or another and this is certainly true in order to buy land they had the Jews bought tracts of land on which some Arabs sometimes lived sometimes they bought tracts of land on which they weren't Arab Villages but sometimes they bought land on which they were Arabs and according to ottoman law and the British at least in the initial a year years of the the British mandate the law said that the people who bought the land could do what they liked with the people who didn't own the land who were basically squatting on the land which is the Arab tenant Farmers which is we're talking about a very small number actually of Arabs who were displaced as a result of land purchases in the automon period or the Mandate period but there was dispossession in one way they didn't possess the land they didn't own it but they were removed from the land and this did happen in Zionism and there's if you like an inevitability in Zionist ideology of buying tracts of land and starting to work at yourself and settle it with your own people and so on that made sense but what we're really talking about is what happened in 47 48 and in 4748 the Arabs started a war and actually people pay for their mistakes and the Palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes they make mistakes they attack they suffer as a a result and we see something similar going on today in GA in the Gaza Strip they do something terrible they kill 1200 Jews they abduct 250 women and children and babies and um old people and whatever and then they start screaming please save us from what we did because the Jews are counterattacking and this is what happened then and this is what's happening now there's something fairly similar in the situation here expulsion and this is important Norman you should pay attention to this you did raise that expulsion transfer were never policy of the Zionist movement before 47 it doesn't exist in a Zionist platforms of the various political parties of the Zionist organization of the Israeli state of the Jewish agency nobody would have actually made it into policy because it was always a large minority if there were people who wanted it always a large minority of Jewish politicians and leaders would have said no this is immoral we cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion so it was never adopted and actually was never adopted as policy even in 48 even though Boran wanted as few Arabs in the course of the war staying in the Jewish state after they attacked it he didn't want this loyal citizen staying there because they wouldn't have been loyal citizens but this made sense in the war itself but the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it it's true that in 1937 when the British as part of the proposal by the peel commission um to divide the country into two states one Arab one Jewish which the Arabs of course rejected a appeal also recommended that the Arabs most of the Arabs in the Jewish state to be should be transferred because otherwise if they stayed and were disloyal to the emerging Jewish State this would cause endless disturbances Warfare killing and so on a so Boran and whitesman latched onto this proposal by the F most famous America democracy in the world the British democracy when they proposed the idea of transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense um and they said well if the British say so we should also advocated but they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938 so just to clarify what you're saying is that uh 40 7 was an offensive War not a defensive War by the Arabs yes by the Arabs yeah and you're also saying that there was never a top down policy of expulsion yes just to clarify the point if I understood you correctly um you're making you're making the claim that transfer expulsion and so on was was in fact a very localized phenomenon result resulting from individual land purchases um and that if I understand you correctly you're also making the claim um that the idea that a Jewish State requires a um removal or overwhelming reduction of the non-jewish population was if the Arabs are attacking you yes but but that let's say prior to 1947 it would be your claim um that the idea that a significant reduction or wholesale removal of the a population was not part of of Zionist thinking well I I think there's two problems with that um I think what you're saying about localized uh disputes is correct but I also think that um uh there is a whole literature that demonstrates um that transfer was envisioned by Zionist leaders on a much broader scale than simply individual land purchases in other words it's it it went Way Beyond we need to remove these tenants so that we can form this land the idea was we can't have a state where all these Arabs remain and we have to get rid of them and the second I think impediment to to that view is that long before the UN General Assembly convened um to address the question of Palestine Palestinian and Arab and other leaders as well had been warning at infinitum that the purpose of the Zionist movement is not just to establish a Jewish state but to establish an exclusivist uh Jewish State and that transfer Force displacement um uh was fundamental um uh to that uh project and just respond to um uh sorry was it bonell or with a B yeah yeah um you made the point that um uh the the problem here is that people don't recognize is that the first and last result for the Arabs is always War I think there's a problem with that I think um you might do well to recall um the 1936 general strike conducted by pales Ians um at the beginning of the Revolt which at the time was the longest recorded uh general strike in history um you may want to consult um the book uh published last year by Lori Allen a history of false hope which discusses in great detail the consistent engagement by Palestinians their leaders their Elites their diplomats and so on with all these International committees if we look at today the Palestinians are once again going to the international court of justice um they're consistently trying to persuade uh the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court to um do his job um they have launched widespread uh boycott campaigns so of course the Palestinians have engaged in um uh military resistance but I think the suggestion that this has always been their first and Last Resort and that they have somehow spurned Civic action spurned diplomacy I I think really has no basis uh in reality I'll respond to that and then a question for Norm to take into account I think when he answers Benny because I am curious obviously uh I have fresher eyes on this and I'm a newcomer to this Arena versus the three of you guys for sure um a claim that gets brought up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer in Zionism or the idea that as soon as the Jews envisioned a state and Palestine they knew that it would involve some Mass transfer of population perhaps a mass expulsion um I'm sure we'll talk about plan Dall or Plan D at some point the issue that I run into is while you can find quotes from leaders while you can find maybe desires expressed in Diaries I feel like it's hard to truly ever know if there would have been Mass transfer in the face of Arab peace because I feel like every time there was a huge deal on the table that would have had a sizable Jewish and Arab population living together the Arabs would reject it out of hand so for instance when we say that transfer was inevitable when we say that zionists would have never accepted you know a sizable Arab population how do you explain the acceptance of the 47 partition plan that would have had a huge Arab population living in the Jewish state is your contention that after the acceptance of that after the establishment of that state that Jews would have slowly started to expel all of these Arab citizens from their country or how do you explained that in lcan couple years later that Israel was willing to formally Annex the Gaza Strip and make 200,000 or so people those citizens but but I'm I'm just curious how how do we get this idea of Zionism always means Mass transfer when there were times at least early on in the history of Israel and and a little bit before it where Israel would have accepted a state that would have had a massive Arab population in it is your yeah is your idea that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards or is that question to me or Norm either one I'm just curious with the incorporation of the answer yeah um there is some misunderstandings here so let's try to clarify that number one it was the old historians who would point to the fact in Professor Morris's terminology the old historians what he called not real historians he called them chroniclers not real historians it was the old Israeli historians who denied the centrality of transfer in Zionist thinking it was then Professor moris who contrary to Israel's historic historian establishment who said now you remind me it's four pages but it came at the end of the book it was no no it's at the beginning of the book transfer yes transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the palan refugee problem it's a fault of my memory but the point still stands it was Professor Maris who introduced this idea in what you might call A way yeah but I didn't say every the central to Des Des experiment or experience you're saying centrality I never said it was Central I said it was there the idea it's by the way it's okay to respond back and forth this is great and also just a quick question if I may you're using quotes from from Benny from Professor Morris uh it's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect the cont of so like if we go back if you know to quotes we've said in the past and both here have written the three of you have written on this topic a lot is we should be careful and just admit like well yeah well just well real quick just to be clear that the contention is that Norm is quoting a part and saying that this was the entire reason for this whereas Benny saying it's a part of I'm not quoting a part I'm quoting 25 Pages where Professor moris was at Great pains to document the claim that appeared in those early four pages of his book now you say it never became part of the official Zionist platform never became part of policy F we're also asked well this is true why did that happen why did that happen it's because it's a very simple fact which everybody understands ideology doesn't operate in vacuum there are real world practical problems you can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality and turn it into a fact it was the British mandate there was significant Arab resistance to Zionism and that resistance was based on the fact as you said the Fe Fe of territorial displacement and dispossession so you couldn't very well expect the Zionist movement to come out in neon lights and announce hey we're going to be expelling you the first chance we get can that's not realistic okay let me respond look you said you've said it a number of times that um um the Arabs from fairly early on in the be in the conflict from the 1890s or the early 1900s said the Jews intend to expel us this doesn't mean that it's true it means that some Arabs said this maybe believing it was true maybe using it as a political instrument to gain support to mobilize Arabs against the Zionist experiment but the fact is transfer did not occur before 1947 um and Arabs later said and then and since then have said that the Jews want to build a third temple on the Temple mount um as if that's what really the the mainstream of Zionism has always wanted and always strived for but this is nonsense it's something that kusini used to use as a way to mobilize masses for the cause using religion as as the way to get them to to join join him um the fact that Arabs said that they the Zionist want to dispossess us doesn't mean it's true it just means that there some Arabs thought that maybe and maybe said it since and maybe insincerely Professor Morris later it became a self-fulfilling prophecy this is true Arabs attacked the Jews Professor Maris I read through your stuff even yesterday I was looking through righteous victim you should read other things you're wasting your time no no actually no I do read other things but I don't consider it a waste of time to read you not at all um you say that this wasn't inherent in Zionism now would you all agree that Ben David benorian was a Zionist a z major Zionist right would you agree Ken vitman was a Zionist yeah okay I believe they were I believe they took their ideology seriously it was the first generation just like with the Bolsheviks the first generation was committed to an idea by the 1930s it was just pure raop politic the IDE went out the window the first generation I have no doubt about their convictions okay they were zionists transfer was inevitable and inbu in Zionism you keep repeating the same because I have as I said Benny Mr moris I have a problem reconciling what you're saying it either was incidental or it was deeply entrenched here I read it's deeply entrenched two very resonant words inevitable and inbuilt deeply entrenched I never wrote I'm not sure it's something you just invented but but in inable and the idea let me concede let me concede something the idea of transfer was there Israel zangvil a British Zionist talked about it early on in the century even Herzel in some way talked about transferring according to your 25 Pages everybody talked about on we keep bringing up this line from the 25 pages and the four pages uh you know we're lucky to have Benny in front of us right now we don't need to go to the quotes at like we can legitimately ask how Central is expulsion to Zionism uh in its early version of Zionism and what whatever Zionism is today and how much power uh influence the Zionism and ideology have in Israel and like influence the Phil the philosophy the ideology of Zionism have on Israel today the Zionist movement up to 1948 Zionist ideology was Central to the the whole Zionist experience the whole Enterprise up to 1948 and I think Zionist ideology was also important um in the first Decades of Israel's existence um slowly the the the um hold of Zionism like if you like like like bolshevism held the Soviet Union gradually faded and a lot of Israelis today think in terms of individual success and then the capitalism and all all sorts of things which nothing to do with Zionism but Zionism was very important but what I'm saying is that the idea of transfer wasn't the core of Zionism the idea of Zionism was to save the Jews who had been vastly persecuted a in in Eastern Europe and incidentally in the Arab world the Muslim world for centuries um and eventually ending up with the Holocaust the idea of Zionism was to save the Jewish people by establishing a state or reestablishing a Jewish State on the ancient Jewish homeland which is something the Arabs today even deny that there were Jews in Palestine or the land of Israel a 2,000 years ago Arafat famously said what Temple was there on Temple Mount maybe it was in Nablus which of course is nonsense but but um they had a connection strong connection for thousands of years to the land to which they wanted to return and returned there they found that on the land lived hundreds of thousands of Arabs and the question was how to accommodate the vision of a Jewish state in Palestine alongside the existence of these um um Arab masses living on who were indigenous in fact to The Land by that stage um and the idea of partition because they couldn't live together because the Arabs didn't want to live together with the Jews and I think the Jews also didn't want to live together in one state with Arabs in general the idea of partition was the thing which um the zionists accepted okay we can we can only get a small part of Palestine the Arabs will get in 37 most of Palestine in 1947 the the ratios were changed but we can we can live side by side with each other in a partitioned Palestine and this was the essence of it the idea of transfer was there but it was never adopted by as policy but in 1947-48 the Arabs attacked trying to destroy essentially the Jewish the Zionist Enterprise and the emerging Jewish State and a um the reaction was a transfer in some way a not as policy but this is what happened on the battlefield and this is also what Boran at some point began to want as well right well you know one of the first um books on this issue uh I read uh when I was still in high school because my my late father had it was a Diaries of Theodore Herzel and I think you know Theodore Herzel of course was was the founder of of the Contemporary Zionist movement and I think if you read that it's very clear for Herzel the model upon which the Zionist movement would uh would proceed his model was Cil Ro roads has um I think you know roads from what I recall correct me if I'm wrong has quite a prominent place in uh herzl's Diaries I think Herzel was also corresponding uh with him and seeking his support cesil rhods of course was um uh was the uh British um colonialist after whom the former white minori regime in uh in rudia uh was named and Herzel also says explicitly in his diaries that it is essential um to remove uh the existing population from Palestine can I respond to this in a moment please he says we shall have to spear the penniless population across the borders and procure employment for them elsewhere or something and Israel zil who you mentioned a land without a people for a people without a land they knew damn well it wasn't a people a land without a people um I'll continue but but please go just to this there is one small diary entry in herz's vast volumes yeah five volumes there's one paragraph which actually mentions the idea of transfer there are people who I think that Herzel was actually pointing to South America when he was talking about that the Jews were going to move to Argentina and then they would try and a buy out or buy off or Spirit the the penniless natives um to make way for Jewish settlement maybe he wasn't even talking about the Arabs in that particular passage that's the argument of some people maybe he was but the point is it it has only a one 100th of a 1% of the Diary which is devoted to the subject it's not a central idea in Herzel in herz's thinking the what Herzel wanted and this is what's important not RADS I don't think he was the model Herzel wanted to create a liberal Democratic Western State in Palestine for the Jews that's that was the idea not some Imperial Enterprise serving some Imperial Master which is what rhs was about but to have a Jewish state which was modeled on the western democracies in in Palestine and this incidentally was more or less what whitesman and Boran Boran wanted they Boran was more of a socialist whitesman was more of a liberal a um Westerner but they wanted to establish a Social Democratic or liberal state in Palestine and they both envisioned through most of the years of their activity that there would be an Arab minority in that Jewish State it's true that benguan strive to have as small as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish State because he knew that if you want a Jewish majority state that that would be necessary but it's not something which they were willing to translate into actual policy uh just a quick pause to mention that for people who are not familiar The Herzel we're talking about a century ago and everything we've been talking about has been mostly 1948 and before yes just one clarification on herzl's Diaries I mean the other thing that I recall from those Diaries is he was um he was very preoccupied with in fact getting great power patronage seeing Palestine um the Jewish state in Palestine I think his words an outpost of civilization against barbarism yes in other words very much um seeing his project as a prox as a proxy for Western imperialism in the Middle East right word not proxy he wanted to establish a Jewish state which would be independent to get that he hoped that he would be able to Garner support from major Imperial Powers including including the ottoman Sultan he tried to cultivate I just want to respond to a point you made earlier which was that people expressed their rejection of the partition resolution um on the grounds that it gave the majority of the of Palestine to the Jewish Community which formed only a third um whereas in fact uh if I understood you correctly you're saying the Palestinians and the Arabs would have rejected any partition resolution yeah I think a couple things that one they would have rejected any two a lot of that land given was in the nigab it was pretty terrible land at the time and three the land that would have been partitioned to Jews I think would have been um I think I saw it was like 500,000 ER would have been 500,000 Jews 400,000 Arabs and I think like 80,000 bedwin would have been there so the the state would have been I think you raised a valid point um because I think the Palestinians did reject the partition of their Homeland in principle and I think the fact that um the United Nations General Assembly then awarded the majority of their Homeland um uh to the Zionist movement only added insult to injury I mean uh um uh one doesn't have to sympathize with the Palestinians um to recognize that they have now been a stateless people for 75 years can you name any country yours for example or yours that would be prepared to give 55% 25% 10% of your country to the Palestinians of course not and so um the issue was not the existence of Jews in Palestine um they had been there for centuries and of course they had ties to Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem and and other places going back centuries if not Millennia um but the idea of establishing an exclusively Jewish State at the expense of those who are already living there I think it was right to reject that and I don't think we can look back now 75 years later and say well you should have accepted losing 55% of your Homeland because you ended up losing 78% of it the addition and the remaining 22% was occupied in 1967 that's that's not how things work yeah um and I can I can imagine I can imagine an American rejecting giving 10% of the United States to the Palestinians and if that rejection leads to war and you lose half your country I doubt that 50 years from now you're going to say well maybe I should have accepted that sure so I like this answer more than what I usually feel like I'm hearing when it comes to the Palestinian rejection of the 47 partition plan because sometimes I feel like a weird switch happens to where the Arabs in the area are actually presented as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing a calculation and saying like well we're losing 55% of our land Jews are only maybe onethird of the people here and we've got 45 and N the math doesn't work basically but it wasn't a math problem I think like you said it was a matter of principle it was an ideology problem no it was a matter of principle yeah ideologically driven that that they as a as a people have a right to or entitled to this land that they've never actually had an independent state on that they've never had even a guarantee of an independent state on that they've never actually ruled a govern that last point is actually not correct because for all its Injustice um the mandate system recognized Palestine as a class a mandate which provisionally recognized the independence of of that territory of what would emerge from that territory but not thees it was provisionally recognized but not but the the territory itself was but not of the Palestinian people to have a right or a guaranteed to a government that was a British Mandate of Palestine not the British Mandate of Israel the word exclusive which you keep using is nonsense the state which benan envisioned would be a Jewish majority State as they accepted the 1947 partition resolution as Steven said that included 400,000 plus Arabs in a state which would have 500,000 Jews so the idea of exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air at all among the Zionist leaders in 4748 they wanted a Jewish majority state but were willing to accept a state which had 40% Arabs that's one point the second thing is the Palestinians may have regarded the land of Palestine as their Homeland but so did the Jews it was the homeland of the Jews as well the problem was the Arabs were unable and remain to this day unable to recognize that for the Jews that is their Homeland as well and the problem then is how do you share this Homeland either with one bational state or separate this partitioned into two states the problem is that the Arabs have always rejected both of these ideas the Homeland belongs to the Jews as Jews feel as much as it does not more than for the Arabs I would say for the Jews it's the Jewish I would also real quick I just want for both of you guys because I haven't heard these questions answered I really want these questions to be I'm just so curious how to make sense of them um it was correctly brought up that I believe that benan had um I think Schmo benam describes it as an obsession with getting validation or support from Western States um Great Britain and then a couple decades later explains the su's war the's crisis exactly correct that was one of the major motivators the idea to work with Britain and France on a military operation but then the question again I go back to if that is true if beneran if the early uh Israel saw themselves as a western Fashion Nation how could we possibly imagine that they would have engaged in the transfer of some 400,000 Arabs after accepting the partition plan would that not have completely and totally destroyed their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire Western world would not have been how not well first of all I think that that the Zionist leadership's acceptance of um the partition resolution um and and I think you may written about this that they accepted it because it provided International endorsement of the the legitimacy of the principle of Jewish statehood and they didn't accept the borders um and in fact uh later expanded the borders second of all the borders the borders they accepted the UN partition resolution borders and all they you can say that some of the zionists deep in their hearts had the the idea that maybe incl to including their most senior leaders who said so and I think you've quoted them they grudgingly accepted what the United Nation the world Community had said this is what you're going to get and and second of all I mean removing dark people darker people it's dark it's inic are as dark as Arabs it's intrinsic to Western history so the idea that Americans or Brits or the French would have an issue with I mean French had been doing it in Algeria for decades the Americans have been doing it in North America for centuries so how would Israel forcibly displacing um Palestinians somehow besmer um uh Israel in the eyes of the West even in the 1944 resolution of the labor party and at the time even Bertrand Russell was a member of the labor party it endorsed transfer of Arabs out of Palestine as m pointed out that was a deeply entrenched idea in Western thinking that there was nothing uh it doesn't in any way contradict or violate or breach any moral values to displace uh the Palestinian population now I do believe there's a legitimate question had it been the case as you said Professor Mars that the zionists wanted to create a happy state with a Jewish majority but a large Jewish minority and if by virtue of immigration like in our own country in our own country given the current trajectories nonwhites will become the majority population in our United States quite soon and according to democratic principles we have to accept that so if that were the case I would say maybe there's an argument that had there been Mass Jew Jewish immigration changed the demographic balance in Palestine and therefore uh Jews became the majority you can make an argument in the abstract that the indigenous Arab population should have been accepting of that just as whites in the United States quote unquote whites have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is Shifting to non-whites in our own country but that's not what Zionism was about I did write my doctrinal dissertation on Zionism and I don't want to get now bogged down in abstract ideas but as I suspect you know most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of nationalism one is a nationalism based on citizenship you become a citizen you're integral to the country that's sometimes called political nationalism and then there's another kind of nationalism and that says the state should not belong to its citizens it should belong to an ethnic group each ethnic group should have its own State it's usually called the German romantic idea of nationalism Zionism is squarely in the Jew German romantic idea that was the whole point of Zionism we don't want to be bundists and be one more ethnic minority in Russia we don't want to become citizens and just become a Jewish people in England or friends we want our own State like like the arab3 states no wait let's before we get to the Arabs let's get let's stick to the Jews for a moment or the zionists we want our own State and in that concept of wanting your own State the minority at best lives on sufferance and at worst gets expelled that's the logic of the German romantic Zionist idea of a state that's why they're zionists now I personally have shied away from using the word Zionism ever since I finished my doctoral dissertation because painful because as I said I don't believe it's the operative ideology today it's like talking about bism and referring to Kush I doubt Kush could have spelled bik but for the period we're talking about they were zionists they were committed to their exclusive state with with a minority living on sufferance or at worst expelled that was their ideology and I really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these Western Democrats like vitman and they wanted to live peacefully with the Arabs vitman described the exposion in 1948 as quote the miraculous clearing of the land that doesn't sound like somebody shedding Too Many Tears at the loss of the indigenous population let me just respond to the word unsuffer the unsuffer I don't agree with I think that's wrong the Jewish State came into being in 1948 it had a population which was 20% Arab when it came into being after Arab refugees many of them had become refugees but 20% remained in the country 20% of Israel's population at Inception in 1949 was Arab 80% went missing no no no no I we talking about what remained in Palestine Israel after it was created um the 20% who lived in Israel received citizenship and all the rights of Israelis except of course the right to serve in the Army which they didn't want to um and they have Supreme Court justices they have knesset members they enjoy basically under laws until 1966 for period sure they lived under they didn't immed no no wait a second at the beginning at the beginning it's not fantasy at the beginning they received citizenship could vote in elections for their own people and they were put into Parliament um but in the first years the Israeli the Jewish majority suspected that maybe the Arabs would be disloyal because they had just tried to destroy the Jewish State then they dropped the military government and they became fully equal citizens um so if the whole idea was they must have a state without Arabs this didn't happen in 49 and it didn't happen in the you say Professor Morris then why did you say without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established because the you're missing the first section of that paragraph was they were being assaulted by the Arabs and as a result a Jewish State could not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill nor I'm officially forbidding you referencing that again hold on a second wait uh we responded to it so the the main point you're making we have to take B's word is like there was uh a war and that's the reason why he made that statement I think just one last point on this I I remember reading your book when it first came out and and and reading you know one incident after the other and and one example after the other and then getting to the conclusion where you said um uh the nakba was a product of War not design I think re ex and I remember reacting almost in in in in shock to that that I felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence that it was a product of design not war and I think our discussion today very much uh reflects let's say the dissonance uh between the evidence and the conclusion you don't feel that that the um uh the research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was in fact um inherent and inbuilt and inevitable um and I think the point that Norman I are making is is that you're own historical research together with that of others indisputably demonstrates that it does I think that's a fundamental disagreement we're having here can I wait yeah can I actually respond to that because this is actually uh I think this is emblematic of the entire conversation um I watched a lot of norms interviews uh and conversations in preparation for this and I hear normal say this all over and over and over again I only deal in facts I don't deal in hypotheticals I only deal in facts I only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point Point you're trying to push the idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of exposion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition I don't think you understand politics did I just say that there is a Chasm that separates your ideology from the limits and constraints imposed by politics and reality now Professor Mars I suspect would agree that the Zionist movement from fairly early on was committed to the idea of a Jewish State I am aware of only one major study probably written 40 years ago the the bational idea in mandatory Palestine by a woman I forgot her name now you'll remember her I'm trying to yeah okay but you know the book I think so yeah she is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the Zionist movement was actually not formally actually committed to the bational idea but most historians of the subject agree the Zionist movement was committed to the idea of a Jewish State having written by doctoral dissertation on the topic I was confirmed in that idea because Professor chsky who was my closest friend for about 40 years was very committed to the idea that b nationalism was the dominant Trend in Zionism I could not agree with I couldn't go with him there but Professor moris you are aware that until the builtmore resolution in 1942 the Zionist movement never declared it was for a Jewish State why because it was politically impossible at the moment until 1942 there is your ideology there are your convictions there are your operative plans and there's also separately what you say in public the Zionist movement couldn't say in public we're expelling all the Arabs they can't say that and they couldn't even say we support a Jewish State until 1942 you're conflating two things that the The zionists Wanted a Jewish State correct that didn't mean expulsion of the Arabs it's not the same thing they wanted a Jewish state with a Jewish majority but they were willing as it turned out both in 37 and in 40 47 and subsequently to have an Arab minority transfer a large Arab minor there was a trans they were willing to have a large Arab minority in the country and they ended up with a large Arab minority in the country 20% of the population in 49 was Arab and they ended up for about 5 minutes before they were expelled they agreed to end up till 47 and then they were gone by March 1949 what happened in between the rejection of the partition plan and the expulsion of the Arabs the Arabs launched the war well yeah I mean like it's not it wasn't random like there's a potential that agree it wasn't random I totally agree with that it was by Design youand you can say that but in this case the facts betray you there was no Arab acceptance of anything that would have allowed for a Jewish state to exist number one and number two I think that it's entirely possible given how things happen after war that this exact same conflict could have played out and an explosion would have happened without any ideology at play that there was a people that disagreed on who had territorial rights to a land there was a massive war afterwards and then a bunch of their friends invaded after to reinforce the idea that the Jewish people in this case couldn't have a state there could have been a transfer regardless anything could have been that's not what history is about history is about Palestinian rection is to any peace deal over over I said when the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations they were faced with a practical problem and I for one am not going to try to adjudicate the Rights and Wrongs from the beginning I do not believe that if territorial displacement and dispossession was inherent in the Zionist project I do not believe it can be a legitimate political Enterprise now you might say that's speaking from 2022 or 202 now okay but we have to recognize that from nearly the beginning for perfectly obvious reasons having nothing to do with anti-semitism anti- westernism anti-europeanism but because no people that I am aware of would voluntarily seed its country all that sold voluntarily you can perfectly understand native American resistance to Euro colonialism you can perfectly well understanded without any anti-europeanism anti-h ism anti- christianism they didn't want to seed their country to Invaders that's completely understandable you're minimizing the anti-semitic element you minim in Arab Nation all your books you minimized no no no the husseini was an anti-site the leader of the Palestinian national movement in the 30s and 40s was an anti-site this was one of the things which drove him and also drove him in the end to work in Berlin for Hitler for four years with Nazi giving Nazi propaganda to the Arab world calling on the Arabs to murder the Jews that's what he did in World War II that's the leader of the Palestinian Arab national movement and he wasn't alone he wasn't alone why is it have you read your book righteous victims you can read it and read it and read it and read it as I have you will find barely a word about the Arabs being motivated by anti-Semitism it exists though I didn't say it doesn't exist you agree that it exists hey I don't know a single non-jew who doesn't Harbor anti-semitic talking about Arabs now yeah but I don't know anybody that's just part of the human condition anti-Semitism among the Arabs so Professor Mars here's my problem I didn't see that in your righteous victims even when you talked about the first in father and you talked about the second into F and you talked about how there was a lot of influence by Hamas the Islamic movement you even stated that there was a lot of anti-Semitism in those movements but then you went on to say but of course at bottom it was about the occupation it wasn't about and I've read it yeah yeah but you're moving from different I'm notes across the ages talk about your whole book The began the one talking about I looked and looked and looked for evidence of this anti-Semitism as being a chief motor of Arab resistance to P Zionism I didn't see it you like did he make that claim I don't remember the word Chief it's it's one of the element very binary yes binary please don't give me this postmodernism binary you're the one you are thinking in terms of you're the one that said the do you have your book here talk about 137 talk in black and white you're talking in black and white Concepts when history is much grayer lots of things happen because of lots of reasons not one or the other and and you don't you don't seem to see that can I ask to because it's for them to talk to to very quick question what was what do you think the ideal solution was on the Arab side from 47 what would they have preferred and what would happened and then then the second one what would have happened if Jews would have lost the war in 48 what do you think would have happened to the Israeli population Jewish population I think the the Palestinians and the Arabs uh were explicit that they wanted a unitary I think Federal uh State and and they made their submissions to uh unscop uh they made their um uh appeals at the UN General Assembly what do you mean by Unitarian Federal I don't get that they wanted an Arab State they wanted Palestine to be an Arab State simply the word unitary federal they wanted Palestine Arab an exclusively Arab State no wasn't an no wasn't an exclusively Arab State I think we have to distinguish between Palestinian and Arab opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine on the one hand and um Palestinian and Arab attitudes to um Jewish existence in Palestine there's a fundamental difference the leader of the movement said that all the Jews who had come since 1917 and that's the majority of the Jews in Palestine 1947 shouldn't be there they shouldn't be citizens and they shouldn't be there4 I'm not also it's true I can understand the sentiment but I think it's wrong but also you you we agree on I also you guys you used the words earlier that it was Supremacy and exclusivity that the Zion I want to answer your question um as you husseini did say that and I'm sure there was a very substantial uh body of Palestinian Arab public opinion that endorsed that um but by the same token I think um uh unitary Arab State as you call it or a Palestinian State could have been established with arrangements with guarantees um to ensure the security and rights of of both communities how that would work in detail had had been um uh discussed and proposed but never uh resolved and again I think you know Jewish fears about what would have second Holocaust that's what we no I I think that was the Jewish fear a second Holocaust that that may well have been the Jewish fear it was an unfounded uh Jewish fear it was unfounded of course it was unfounded what about like in 48 and you really think you really think that the Palestinians had they won the war were going to import ovens and crematoria from Germany but there were programs across in almost every single Arab state where there were Jews living after after 48 after 56 after 67 there were always progrms there were always flights from Jews from those countries to Israel afterward I think I wouldn't I wouldn't say there were always pograms in every Arab State I think there was flight of of um uh Arab Jews for multiple reasons in some cases for precisely the reasons you say if you look at the Jewish community in Algeria for example their flight had virtually nothing to do with um uh the Arab Israel conflict the issue of of Algerian Jews was that the French gave them citizenship during their colonial rule of Algeria and they increasingly became identified uh with French rule and when Algeria became independent and um all the French um ended up uh uh leaving out of fear or out of disappointment or out of whatever um the Jews were identified as French rather than Algerian this is a bit of a red hairing there were programs in the Arab countries in bahin even where there's almost no Jews there was a prog in 1947 there was a pram Aleppo in 1947 I'm not denying any of that history killings of Jews in Iraq and Egypt in 1948 49 so but the Arabs the Jews basically fled the Arab states not for multiple reasons they fled because they felt that the governments there and the societies am Amid Amid which they had lived for hundreds of years no longer want look without without getting into the details I think we can both agree that ultimately a clear majority of Arab Jews who believed that after having lived in these countries for for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries if not Millennia um came to the unfortunate conclusion that their situation had become untenable yes um I also think um that we can both agree that this had never been an issue prior to Zionism and the emergence of the state of isra prior to Zionism GRS didn't begin with Zionism in the Arab world the issue is is is is the point I raised which is whether these communities had ever come to a collective conclusion that their position had become untenable in this part of the world no they were Arab Jews well because untable meant there was no alternative but with the creation of Israel there was an alternative right a place where they could go and not be discriminated against or live as second class citizens or be subject to Arab majority States I I also think it's interesting that like when you analyze the um the flight of Jewish people and I've seen this that there it's not it wasn't just I agree with you it wasn't just a mass exposion from all the Arab states there were definitely push factors there were also pull factors now I don't know how you guys feel about the knba but when the analysis the nakba comes in again it's back to that well that was actually just a top- down exposion um you know the retreat of wealthy Arab people in the 30s didn't matter uh any of the messaging from the surrounding Arab states didn't matter it was just an expulsion from Jewish people or people running from their lives from Jewish massacres um again it's like that I feel like it's a SEL a stive critical analis the term Jewish here because it wasn't the you know the Jews of England or the Soviet say jewi because prior to 48 say Israeli you I think we should I think it's useful to to say um referred to zionists before 1948 and Israelis after 48 we don't need to implicate um well sure but but the Jewish people that were being attacked in Arab states weren't zionists they were just Jews living there just comment on that I was rereading uh schlomo bami's last book and he does at the end discuss at some length the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on the so-called peace process and on the question of 48 and the Arab immigration if you allow me let me just quote him Israel is particularly fond of the awkwardly full FSE symmetry she makes between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced immigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries following the creation of the state of Israel as if it were quote an unplanned exchange of UNP populations unquote and then Mr benami for those of you who are listening he was Israel's former foreign minister and he's an influential historian in his own right he says in fact envoys from the mosad and the Jewish agency worked underground in Arab countries and Iran to encourage Jews to go to Israel more importantly for many Jews in Arab states the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millennial aspirations it represented the consummation of a dream to take part in Israel's Resurgence as a nation so this idea that they were all expelled after 1948 it's that's one area Professor Maris I defer to expertise that's one of my credos in life I don't know the Israeli literature but as it's been translated in English there is very little solid scholarship on what happened in 194 48 in the Arab countries and which caused the Jews to leave Arab Jews the Arab Jews right uh but uh shomo benami knows the literature he knows the scholarship he's a his yeah from morocc right so he knows from Iraq was written on this issue and they wrote that the Jews and the Arab lands were not pro zionists they weren't zionists at all certainly ai's family was anti and AI schlim when he was interviewed by Marin Rapaport on this question he said you simply cannot say that the Iraqi Jews were expelled it's just not true and he was speaking as an Iraqi Jew who left with his father family in 1948 they were pushed out they weren't expelled well that that's probably the right phrase they were pushed I think it's more complex than than that I think it was sorry I interrupted you no you're not interrupting me because I don't I I only know what's been translated into English and the English literature on the subject is very small and not scholarly now there may be an uh Hebrew literature I don't know but I was surprised that even schomo benami a stward of his state fair enough on this particular point he called it false symmetry no no step is right there was a pull and push mechanism in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post 48 but there was also a lot of push a lot of push that's that's indisputable there was p and on the point of agreement let on this one brief light of agreement let us wrap up with this uh topic of history and move on to modern day but before that I'm wondering if uh we can just say a couple of last words on this topic Stephen yeah I think that when you look at the behaviors of both parties uh in in the time period around 48 or especially 48 and earlier um there's this assumption that there was this huge built-in mechanism of Zionism and that it was going to be inevitable from the Inception of the first Zionist thought I I guess that appeared in herz's mind that there would be a mass violent population transfer of Arab Palestinians out of what would become the Israeli State uh I understand that there are some quotes that we can find that maybe seem to possibly support an idea that looks close to that but I think when you actually consult the record of what happened when you look at the populations the massive populations that Israel was willing to accept uh within what would be become their state borders their nation borders uh I just don't think that the historical record agrees with the idea that Zionist would have just never been okay living alongside Arab Palestinians uh but when you look at the other side Arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land for any state relating to Jewish people or the Israeli people I think it was said even on the other end of the table that uh Arab Palestinians would have never accepted the Arabs would have never accepted any Jewish State whatsoever so it's interesting that on the ideology part where it's claimed that zionists are people of exclusion and Supremacy and expulsion uh we can find that in Diary entries but we can find that expressed in very real terms on the Arab side I think in all of their behavior around 48 and earlier where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli State um it would have been the dispossession of many Jewish people it probably would have been the exposion of a lot of them back to Europe and I think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions of the Arabs versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders Benny well one thing which stood out and um I think mu made this point is that the Arabs had nothing to do with the Holocaust but then the world Community forced the Arabs to pay the price for the Holocaust that's the traditional Arab argument um this is slightly distorting the reality the Arabs in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent Jewish IM immigration from Europe and reaching Palestine which was the only Safe Haven available because America Britain France nobody wanted Jews anywhere and they were being persecuted in Central Europe and eventually would be massacred in large numbers so the Arab effort to pressure the British to prevent Jews reaching palestine's safe Shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many Jews in Europe because they couldn't get to anywhere and they couldn't get to Palestine because the Arabs were busy attacking Jews in Palestine and attacking the British to make sure they didn't allow Jews to reach this Safe Haven that's important the second thing is of course there's no point in belittling the fact that the Arab Palestinian Arab National movements leader husseini um worked for the Nazis in the 1940s he got a salary from the German foreign Ministry he raised troops among Muslims in Bosnia for the SS and he broadcast to the Arab world calling for the murder of the Jews in the Middle East this is what he did and the Arabs since then have been trying to whitewash Hussein's role um and not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust but he did he helped helped the Arab the Germans along in in doing what they were doing and and supported them in doing that so there this can't be removed from the fact that the Arabs um as you say paid a price for the Holocaust but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen right I'll make two points um the first is um you mentioned ha husseini and his uh collaboration with the Nazis entirely legitimate point to raise but I think one can also say definitively had Haj am Al husseini never existed the Holocaust would have played out precisely certainly um as it did certainly as far as um Palestinian opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine um during the 1930s is concerned it was of a different character than for example British and American um rejection of uh Jewish immigration they just didn't want Jews on their soil objectively it helped the Germans kill the Jews and the Palestinian case their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their Homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them and I think that's an important distinction to make um the other point I wanted to make is we've we've spent the past several hours talking about uh uh Zionism transfer and so on but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this which is that um Zionism I think would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project had it not been for the British um what the preeminent Palestinian historian wi khedi um has turned the British Shield because I think without the British sponsorship we wouldn't be having this discussion today um the British um uh sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason which is that during World War I uh the ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suz uh Canal Suz Canal was the jugular vein of uh the British Empire um you know between uh Europe and India and the British came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the suas canal from any threat and as the British have done so often in so many places how do you deal with this well you know you you bring in a uh foreign minority implant them amongst a hostile uh population and establish a protectorate over them I don't think um a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of br intentions and the bfor Declaration very specifically speaks about a Jewish National home in Palestine in other words a British protectorate um things ended up taking a different course um and I think the the the most important development was uh World War II and I think this had maybe less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of the United Kingdom uh during that war and its inability to sustain um its Global uh Empire it ended up giving up India ended up giving up uh Palestine and it's in that context I think that we need to see um uh the emergence of a uh of a Jewish state in Palestine and again a Jewish State means a state in which the Jewish Community enjoys um not only a demographic majority but an uncontested able demographic majority an uncontestable territorial uh hemony and an uncontestable political Supremacy and that is also why after 1948 the nent Israeli States confiscated I believe up to 90% of uh lands that had been previously owned um by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel it is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966 um it is why the Israeli State effectively um reduced uh the Palestinians living within the Israeli State as citizens of the Israeli state to second class citizens on the one hand promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab um uh nationalist movements and that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state what the Israeli human rights organization bet selum describes a regime of Jewish Supremacy between the river and the Sea you're you're really tempting a response from the other side on on the last few sentences okay we'll talk about the claims of of apartheid and so on it's a fascinating discussion we need to have it uh nor on the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi holus direct or indirect I consider that an absurd claim uh as Gro said and I quoted him the entire Western World turned its back on the Jews to somehow focus on the Palestinians strikes me as completely ridiculous number two as M said there's a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews because in their minds and not irrationally these Jews intended to create a Jewish state which would quite likely have resulted in their exposion I'm a very generous person I've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years but if I knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment I would think 10,000 times before I took him in okay as far as the actual uh complicity of the Palestinian Arabs if you look at uh rul hilberg's three volum volume classic work the destruction of the European jury he has in those thousand plus pages one sentence one sentence on the role of the Muti of Jerusalem and that I think is probably an overstatement but we'll leave it aside the only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is number one I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession and number two there are two issues one is the history and the second is being responsible for your words now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on one of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say and it is discomforting disorienting where you have a person who's produced a voluminous Corpus rich in insight and rich in our kival sources who seems to disown each and every word that you pluck from that Corpus by claiming that it's either out of context or it's cherry picking words count and I agree with Lex everybody has the right to resend what they' have said in the past but what you cannot claim is that you didn't say what you said I'll stick to the history not the current propaganda 1917 the British the the Zionist movement began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades in 1917 the British jumped in and issued the balur Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish National home in Palestine which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine most people understood that in Britain and in is among the zionists and among the Arabs um but the British declared the balur Declaration or issued the balur Declaration not only because of Imperial self-interest and this is a what you're basically saying they had Imperial interests above for state which would protect the SE Canal from the East the British also were motivated by idealism and this incidentally is how balur described the reasoning behind issuing the Declaration and he said the West Western World Western Christendom owes the Jews a great debt both for giving a the the world and the West if you like a values social values as as embodied in the the Bible um social justice and all sorts of other things and the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them for 2,000 years this debt we're now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism but it's also remembering that the Jews um weren't proxies or attached to the British um Imperial Endeavor they were happy to receive British support in 1917 and then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine for 20 30 years um but they weren't part of the British Imperial design or Mission they wanted a state for themselves the Jews happy to have the British support them happy today to have the Americans support his Isel but it's not because we're stoes or extensions of American Imperial interests um the British incidentally always described in Arab narratives of propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism they weren't the first British rulers in Palestine 1917 1920 Herbert Samuel no before Herbert Samuel Samuel came in 1920 the British ruled there for three years previously and most of the leaders the British generals and so on who were in Palestine were anti-zionist and subsequently in the 20s and 30s the British occasionally um curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine and in 1939 switched horses and supported the Arab national movement and not Zionism they turned anti-zionist and basically said you Arabs will rule Palestine within the next 10 years this is what we're giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine a but the Arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on a silver platter husseini again and he said no no we can't accept the British white paper of May 1939 which had given the Arabs everything they wanted basically self-determination in an Arab majority state so what I'm saying is the British a at some point did support the Zionist Enterprise but that other points were less consistent in the support and in 1939 until 1948 when they didn't vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution they didn't support Zion during the last decade of the Mandate it's worth remembering that I I'd like to respond to that I mean speaking of propaganda um I find it simply impossible to accept um that balfor who as British prime minister in 1905 was a chief sponsor of the aliens act which was specifically he changed his mind which was specifically designed keep persecuted Eastern European Jews out of the streets of of the UK and who was denounced as an anti-semite by the entire British Jewish establishment a decade later all of a sudden changed his mind this people Chang their minds but when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide um with the British Imperial interest I think perhaps the transformation is is is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for it it was clearly a British Imperial Venture and if there had been no threat to the Su Canal during World War I regardless of what balur would have thought about the Jews and their contribution to um history and their and their persecution and so on there would have been no B for declaration ask real quick as a question on that why did the British ever cap immigration then from Jews to that area at all well we're talking now about sure but I'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project like there were terrorist attacks from Jewish uh yes but you're you're I'll answer you0 yeah and we're talking now about 1917 and and as I mentioned earlier I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind that's why they used the term Jewish National home I think what they wanted was a British protectorate loyal to and dependent upon uh the British I think an outstanding um review of British policy towards these issues during the Mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria and and he basically makes the argument um that once the British realized the mess they were in certainly by the late 20s early 30s they they recognized these the mess they were in the IR ilable differences and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on um and and um and muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine um whose overall purpose was to serve um for the development of of Zionist institutions yeshua's economy and so on meant even if the British uh were not self-consciously doing this um preparing the ground work for the eventual establishment of a Jewish State I don't know if that answers your question except they did turn anti Zionist in 1939 yes of course Main and maintain that Zionist no no before they were being shot off but maintain that anti-zionist posture until 1948 okay and and if I may just also one point um you mention ha hus during were entirely legitimate um but what I but what I would also point point out is that you had a Zionist organization um the Ley 300 people more 300 people one of whom happened to become an Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli foreign minister speaker of Israeli Parliament um maybe you should give his name Yak Shamir uh proposing an alliance with Nazi Germany in 1941 Shamir propos well no the Ley proposed some people in the Lei proposed of which hamir was a prominent ring no no okay well if he's a red uh was an unimportant organization in the yesu 300 people versus 30,000 belong to the hag so it was not a very important organization it's true before the Holocaust actually began they wanted allies against the British where they could find Talking 1941 1944 41 from what I recall 1940 they were they approached the the German Emissary in or some and and and if I may proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany on what the Le he described as on the basis of shared ideolog shared ideological princip sh ideolog well they said they did they they they reved why are you doing these things of course state but you know you know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology why do you say no do you think that the wait the people were Nazis is that what you're saying I said no are you saying that forget statements you like to quote things but were they were they Naz were the were the Lei Nazis that's what I'm asking what did he some did he say that the basis of the PCT was their agreement on ideology there wasn't any pack they suggested they proposed an agreement right and what did the agreement say they wanted arms against the British that's what they wanted well that's what wanted also that's what people didn't work in in helping the Nazi regime I me what the IRA wanted also no but this is what husseini did you know that he was an anti-site you've probably read some of his Works he wasn't just anti-british he was also anti-semitic and he had a common ground with Hitler simp I think we can agree not every anti-semite is a hitlerite I think we that part he literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people he wasn't just a guy he was an absolutely revolting disgusting human being but the problem is you're saying was influent you're saying the I I don't even understand of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people trying to blame them directly indirectly indirectly or indirectly three times a moved for the Nazi Holocaust is completely lunatic on the wait there's not a he's not blaming them for the Holocaust he's saying that from the perspective wait no he's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region Palestinians would have been part of the region that is exactly he I've him understand him here believe me I'm a lot more literate than you Mr Bell I'm going believe the guy that wrote you read the Wikipedia say I read Hebrew and you call yourself an Israeli historian all on different grounds okay if I can just respond no no I'm just saying that the there were two there were two tricks there were that's fine there were two tricks that are being played here that I think is interesting one is you guys claim that the Ley was trying to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany because of a shared ideology that's what they said yeah but hold on no no no no wait wait no no it's about what you said you brought that up to imply that Zionism must be inexorably linked I'm sorry no you're putting words in my mouth okay wait well then what was the purpose of of saying that the Lei claimed that they the Lei who were small group of people that were reviled by many in Israel not many by everybody practically they were called terrorist theist movement called them terrorists and hunted them and called himself a terrorist they were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of theel Parliament that's Israeli years to Israeli foreign minister and bean was also yes you want you want to characterize him as irrelevant as well go ahead no characteriz him as irrelevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later the timeline matters well the question is what is the point of saying that the Le he tried to forge an relevant it's bringing up the muy of Jerusalem and trying to blame the Holocaust indect hoca the MU was the leader of the Palestine Arab national movement was 300 and he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did no he recruited people for the SS how can you get away from that no he recruited he recruited soldiers in the balans mostly kavars which was disgusting I have no doubt about that but he had one wrote foreign minister don't let the Jews out I for minali forign Minister received letters fromus during during the Holocaust during the Holocaust don't let the Jews out don't let the Jews out I'm not saying he was a major architect minor but if we're agreed if we're agreed that Haj am Al husseini the Muti of Jerusalem collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and actively sought their sponsorship why is it irrelevant and probably wanted the destruction of European jury he probably wanted a lot of things okay okay if that's relevant why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel not prime minister in 1940 41 he wasn't prime minister of Israel he was a leader of a very small terrorist group denounced as terrorist by the main of Zion do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago Mahmud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis which is basically about mmas but I don't didn't bring it up you're the one who's bringing it up beling the Holocaust that's what you're saying the president president of the Palestinian National Authority belittle the Holocaust said it didn't happen or only a few Jews died that's a fair characterization of but I didn't bring it up I brought it up yeah okay because my question is then why is shamir's antecedence irrelevant he he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group was the head of the movement at the time also the the point of bring the point of bring up husseini stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the Holocaust it's that he might have been a great further in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine to escape the Holocaust that that was the plan that and I explained";

  "that's a good point no no it's a good point now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised on YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on one of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say normal say this all over and over and over again I only deal in facts I don't deal in hypotheticals I only deal in facts I only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally to the particular Point you're trying to push the idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of expulsion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition I don't think you understand politics they forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe Shores in Palestine that's what they did and they knew that the Jew were being persecuted in Europe Palestine the only spot of land on Earth yes basically that was the problem the Jews couldn't immigrate about your great friends in Britain The Architects of of the Bal for declar by the late 1930 about the United States W happy to take in Jews and the Americans W happy why and why are Palestinians who were not Europeans who had zero role in the rise of Nazism who had no relation to any of this why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe and un only safe haven for Jews Professor Morris because of your logic and I'm not disputing it that's why October 7th happened oh my God because there was no options left for those people the Kamas guys who attacked the Kim they apart from the attacks on the military sites when they attacked the kibuts were out to kill civilians and they killed family after family house after house talk fast so people think that you're coherent I'm just reading from the UN I know you like them sometimes only when they agree with you though you've lied about this particular instance in the past those kids weren't just on the beach as as often stated articles those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that they had operated from they liter belli with all due respect with all due respect you're such a fantastic it's terrifying the following is a debate on the topic of Israel and Palestine with Norman fenin Benny Morris mu Rabani and Steven benell also known online as Destiny Norman many are historians muen is a Middle East analyst and Steven is a political commentator and streamer all four have spoken and debated extensively on this topic the goal for this debate was not for anyone to win or to score points it wasn't to get views or likes I never care about those and I think there are probably much easier ways to get those things if I did care the goal was to explore together the history present and future of Israel and Palestine in a free flowing conversation no time limits no rules there was a lot of tension in the room from the very beginning and it only got more intense as we went along and I quickly realized that this very conversation in a very real human way was a microcosm of the tensions and distance and perspectives on the topic of Israel and Palestine for some debates I will St step in and moderate strictly to prevent emotion from boiling for this I saw the value in not interfering with the passion of the exchanges because that emotion in itself spoke volumes we did talk about the history and the future but the anger the frustration the biting wit and at times respect and camaraderie were all there like I said we did it in an perhaps all to human way I will do more debates and conversations on these difficult topics and I will continue to search for Hope in the midst of death and destruction to search for our our common Humanity in the midst of division and hate this thing we have going on human civilization the whole of it is beautiful and it's worth figuring out how we can help it flourish together I love you all this is Alex Freedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's Norman felstein Benny Morris muan Rabani and Steven benell first question is about 1948 for Israelis 1948 is the establishment of the state of Israel and the war of independence for Palestinians 1948 is the nakba which means catastrophe or the displacement of 700,000 Palestinians from their home hes as a consequence of the war what to you is important to understand about the events of 1948 and the period around there 47 49 that helps us understand what's going on today and uh maybe helps us understand the roots of all this that started even before 1948 I was hoping that Norm can speak first and Benny then M and then Norm after World War II the British decid that they didn't want to deal with the Palestine question anymore and the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations now as I read the record the UN was not attempting to arbitrate or adjudicate Rights and Wrongs it was confronting a very practical problem there were two national communities in Palestine and there were irreconcilable differences on fundamental questions most importantly looking at the historic record on the question of immigration and associate with the question of immigration the question of lend the UN special committee on Palestine which came into being before the UN 181 partition resolution the UN special committee it recommended two states in Palestine there was a minority position represented by uh Iran India Yugoslavia they supported one state but uh they believed that if forced to the two communities would figure out some sort of modus sendi and live together the United Nations General Assembly supported partition between what it called a Jewish State and an Arab State now in my reading of the record and they understand there's new scholarship in the subject which I've not read but so far as I've read the record there's no Clarity on what the United Nations General said assembly meant by a Jewish State and an Arab State except for the fact that the Jewish state would be demographically the majority would be Jewish and the Arab state demographically would be Arab the unscop the UN special committee on Palestine it was very clear and it was re reiterated many times that in recommending two states each state the Arab State and the Jewish state would have to guarantee full equality of all citizens with regard to political civil and religious matters now that does raise the question if there is absolute full equality of all citizens both in the Jewish state and the Arab state with regard to political rights civil rights and religious rights apart from the demographic majority it's very unclear what it meant to call a state Jewish or call the state Arab in my view the partition resolution was the correct decision I do not believe that the Arab and Jewish communities could at that point be made to live together I disagree with the minority position of India Iran and Yugoslavia and that not being a practical option two states was the only other option in this regard I would want to pay tribute to what was probably the most moving speech at the UN General Assembly proceedings by the Soviet foreign minister gromo I was very tempted to quote it at length but I recognized that would be uh taking too much time uh so I asked a young friend Jamie Stern Wier to edit it and just get the essence of what foreign minister gromo had to say during the last war gromo said the Jewish people underwent exceptional sorrow and suffering without any exaggeration this sorrow and suffering are Indescribable hundreds of thousands of Jews are wandering about in various countries of Europe in search of means of existence and in search of shelter the United Nations cannot and must not regard this situation with indifference past experience particularly during the second world war shows that no Western European state was able to provide adequate assistance for the Jewish people in defending its rights and its very existence from the violence of the Hitler ites and their allies this is an unpleasant fact but unfortunately like all other facts it must be admitted gromo went on to say in principle he supports one state or the Soviet Union supports one state but he said if relations between the Jewish and Arab populations of Palestine proved to be so bad that would be impossible to reconcile them and to ensure the peaceful coexistence of the Arabs and the Jews the Soviet Union would support two states I personally am not convinced that the two states would have been unsustainable in the long term if and this is a big if the Zionist movement had been faithful to the position it proclaimed during the unscop public hearings at the time benorian testified quote I want to express what we mean by a Jewish state we mean by a Jewish State simply a state where the majority of the people are Jews not a state where a Jew has in any way any privilege more than anyone else a Jewish State means a state based on absolute equality of all her citizens and on Democracy alas the this was not to be as Professor Mars has written quote Zionist ideology and practice were necessarily and elementally expansionist and then he wrote in another book transfer the euphemism for exposion transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism because it sought to transform a land which was Arab into a Jewish State and a Jewish State could not have Arisen without a major displacement of Arab population and because this aim automatically produced resistance among the Arabs which in turn persuade the yeshua's leaders the yeshu being the Jewish Community the yeshua's leaders that a hostile Arab majority or large minority could not remain in place if a Jewish state was to arise or safely endure or as Professor Mars retrospectively Put it quote a removing of a population was needed without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established unquote the Arab site rejected outright the partition resolution I won't play games with that I know a lot of people try to prove it's not true it clearly in my view is true the Arab side rejected outright the partition resolution while Israel early leaders acting under compulsions inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism found the pretext in the course of the first Arab Israeli War to expel the indigenous population and expand its borders I therefore conclude that neither side was committed to the letter of the partition resolution and both sides aborted it thank you Norm nor asked that you make a lengthy statement in the beginning uh Benny I hope it's okay to call Everybody by their first name in the name of camaraderie Norm has quoted several things you said uh perhaps you can comment broadly on the question of 1948 and maybe respond to the things that Norm said yeah unscop the United Nations special committee on Palestine um recommended partition the majority of uncope recommended partition which was accepted by the UN General Assembly in November 1947 essentially looking back to the peel Commission in 1937 10 years earlier a British commission had looked at the problem of Palestine the two Waring National groups who refus to live together if you like or um consolidate a a unitary state state between them and and Peele said there should be two states that's the principle The Country Must Be partitioned into two states this would give a modicum of Justice to both sides if not all their demands of course um and the United Nations followed suit the United Nations unop and then the UN General Assembly representing the will of the International Community um said two states is the just solution in this complex situation the problem was that immediately with the passage of the resolution the Arabs the Arab states and the Arabs of Palestine said no as Norman frl Stein said they said no they rejected the partition idea the principle of partition not just the idea of what percentage which side should get but the principle of partition they said no to the Jews should not have any part of Palestine for their Sovereign territory maybe Jews could live as a minority in Palestine that also was problematic in the eyes of the the Palestinian Arab leadership husseini had said only Jews who were there before 1917 could actually get citizenship and continue to live there but the Arabs rejected partition and the Arabs of Palestine launched in very disorganized fashion war against the resolution against the implementation of the resolution against the Jewish community in Palestine um and this was their defeat in that civil war between the two communities while the British were withdrawing from Palestine um led to the Arab Invasion the The Invasion by the Arab states in May 1948 of of the country again basically with the idea of eradicating or preventing the emergence of a Jewish state in line with the United Nations um decision and the will of the International Community Norman said that the Zionist Enterprise and he quoted me meant from the beginning um to transfer or expel the Arabs of Palestine or some of the Arabs of Palestine um and I think he's sort of um quoting out of context the context in which the statements were made that that um the Jewish State could only emerge um if there was a transfer of Arab population was preceded in the way I wrote it and the way it actually happened by Arab resistance and hostilities towards the Jewish Community had the Arabs accepted partition there would have been a large Arab minority in the Jewish state which emerged in 447 and in fact Jewish um economists and state Builders took into account that there would be a large Arab minority and its needs would be cared for ETC um but this was not to be because the Arabs attacked and had they not attacked um perhaps a a a Jewish state with a large Arab minority could have emerged but this didn't happen they went to war the Jews resisted and in the course of that war um Arab populations were driven out some were expelled some left because Arab leaders advised them to leave or ordered them to leave and at the end of the war Israel said they can't return because they just tried to destroy the Jewish State um and and that's the basic reality of what happened in 48 the Jews created a state the Palestinian Arabs never bothered to even try to create a state a before 48 and in the course of the 1948 war and for that reason they have no state to this day the Jews do have a state because they prepared to establish a state fought for it and um established it um hopefully lastingly when you said hostility in case people are not familiar there was a fullon war where Arab States invaded and Israel won that war let me just add to clarify the the war had two parts to it the first part was the Arab community in Palestine its militia men attacked the Jews um a from November 1947 in other words from the day after the UN partition resolution it was passed Arab gunmen were busy shooting up Jews and that snowballed into a fullscale civil war between the two communities in Palestine in May 1948 a second stage began in the war in which the Arab States invaded the new state attacked the new state um and and they too were defeated and thus in the state of Israel emerged in the course of this two-stage War a a vast Palestinian refugee problem um um occurred and so after that the transfer the expulsion the the thing that people call the nakba uh happened um will could you speak to 1948 and the historical significance of it sure um there's there's a lot to unpack here I'll try to limit myself to just a few points regarding Zionism and transfer I think himim whitesman uh the head of the world Zionist organization had it exactly right when he said that the objective of Zionism is to make Palestine as Jewish as England is English or France is French um in other words um as as Norman explains um a Jewish State requires Jewish political demographic and territorial Supremacy without those three elements um the state would be Jewish in name only and I think what distinguishes Zionism is its insistence Supremacy and exclusivity that would be my first point second point is um I think what the Soviet foreign minister at the time Andre gromo said is exactly right with one reservation um gomo was describing a European savagery Unleashed against Europe's Jews at the time you know it wasn't Palestinians or Arabs uh the Savages and The Barbarians were European to the core um it had nothing to do with development in Palestine um uh or the Middle East secondly at the time that groma was speaking um those Jewish uh survivors of the Holocaust and and others who were in need of Safe Haven were still overwhelmingly on the European continent and not on Palestine not in Palestine and I think um given um the scale of the savagery I don't think that any one state or country um should have borne the responsibility uh for addressing this crisis I think it should have been an international uh responsibility um the Soviet Union could have contributed Germany certainly could and should have uh contributed um the United Kingdom and the United States uh which slammed their doors shut to um uh the persecuted Jews of Europe as the Nazis were rising to power they certainly should have uh played a role but instead what passed for the International Community at the time decided to partition Palestine and here I think we need to um uh judge the partition resolution against the realities that obtained at the time um two 2third of the population of Palestine was Arab uh the yeshu the Jewish community in Palestine constituted about onethird of the total population and controlled even less of um of of the land uh within Palestine as as a preeminent Palestinian historian uh W Al khi has pointed out the partition resolution in giving roughly 55% of Palestine to the Jewish Community um and I I think 41 42% uh to the Arab Community to the Palestinians did not preserve the position of each Community or even um uh favor one community at the expense of the others rather it thoroughly inverted and revolutionized uh the relationship uh between between the two communities and as many have written the the neba was the inevitable consequence of partition given the nature of Zionism um given the territorial disposition given the weakness of the Palestinian Community whose leadership had been largely de uh decimated during a major Revolt at the end of the 1930s um given that the Arab states uh were still very much under French and British influence um uh the neba was was um inevitable the inevitable product of the um partition uh resolution and and one last point also about um the the un's partition resolution is yes um formally that is what the International Community decided in on the 29th of November 1947 it's not a resolution that could ever have gotten through the UN General Assembly today for a very simple reason it was a very different General Assembly most African most Asian States um were not yet independent um were the resolution to be placed before the International Community today and I find it telling that um uh the minority opinion was led by India Iran and Yugoslavia I think they would have represented the clear um uh majority so partition given what we know about Zionism given that it was was entirely predictable what would happen given um uh the realities on the ground in Palestine um was deeply unjust and the idea that either the Palestinians or the Arab states could have accepted um such a resolution is is I think um uh an illusion that was in 1947 we saw what happened in 48 and 49 Palestinian Society was essentially um uh destroyed over 80% I believe of Palestinians resident in the territory that became the state of Israel were either expelled or fled uh and ultimately were ethnically cleansed because ethnic cleansing consists of two components it's not just forcing people into Refuge or expelling them it's just as importantly preventing their return and here and and and beny Morris has written I think an article about ysph vites and the transfer committees um there was a very detailed initiative to prevent their return and it consisted of raising hundreds of Palestinian villages to the ground which was systematically implemented and so on and so Palestinians became a stateless people now um what is the most important reason that no Arab state was established um in Palestine well since the 1930s um the Zionist leadership and um the hashm might um uh leadership of uh Jordan as has been uh thoroughly researched and written about by the Israeli British historian aiim essentially colluded um to prevent the establishment of an independent Arab State um in Palestine uh in the late 1940s um there's there's much more here but I think um those those are the key points I I would make about uh 1948 we may talk about Zionism Britain y assemblies and all all the things you mentioned there's a lot to dig into so again if you can keep it to just one statement moving forward after Sten if you want to go a little longer uh also we should acknowledge the fact that the speaking speeds of of people here are different Stephen speaks about 10 times faster uh than me uh Stephen do you want to comment on 1948 yeah I think it's interesting where people choose to start the history um I noticed a lot of people like to start at either 47 or 48 because it's the first time where they can clearly point to a catastrophe that occurs on the Arab side that they want to ascribe 100% of the blame to the newly emergent Israeli state to uh but I feel like when you have this type of reading of History it feels like the goal is to moralize everything first and then to pick and choose facts that kind of support the statements of your initial moral statement afterwards um whenever people are talking about 48 or the establishment of the Arab State uh I never hear about uh the fact that a Civil War started in 47 uh that was largely instigated because of the Arab rejectionism of the 47 partition plan uh I never hear about the fact that the majority of the land that was acquired happened by purchases from Jewish organizations of uh Palestinian Arabs of the Ottoman Empire before the mandatory period in 1920 even started um funnily enough King Abdullah of Jordan uh was quoted as saying the Arabs are as prodical in selling their land as they are in Weeping about it uh I never hear about the multiple times that Arabs rejected partition uh rejected living with Jews um rejected any sort of state that would have even uh had any sort of Jewish exclusivity it's funny because it was brought up before that the partition plan was unfair and that's why the Arabs rejected it as though they rejected it because it was unfair because of the amount of land that Jews were given and not just due to the fact that Jews were given land at all as though a 30% partition or 25% partition would have been accepted when I don't think that was the reality of the circumstances I feel like most of the other stuff has been said but I I I noticed that um whenever people talk about 48 or the years preceding 48 um I think the worst thing that happens is there's a there's a cherry picking of the facts where basically all of the blame is ascribed to this uh this built-in idea of Zionism that because of a handful of quotes or because of an ideology we can say that transfer or population exposion or the the basically the Mandate of all of these Arabs being kicked off the land was always going to happen when I think there's a refusal sometimes as well to acknowledge that regardless of the ideas of some of the Zionist leaders there is a political social and Military reality on the ground that they're forced to contend with and unfortunately the Arabs because of their inability to engage in diplomacy and only to use tools of War to try to negotiate everything going on in mandatory Palestine basically always gave the Jews a reason or an excuse to fight and acquire land through that way uh because of their refusal to negotiate on anything else whether it was the partition plan in 47 whether it was the uh the Lucan peace conference afterwards where Israel even offered to Annex Gaza in 51 where they offered to take in 100,000 refugees every single deal is just rejected out of hand because the Arabs don't want a Jewish State anywhere in this region of the world I would like to engage Professor Morris if you don't mind I'm not with the first name it's just not my way of relating you can just call me Morris you don't need the professor okay there's a real problem here and it's been the problem I've had over many years of reading your work apart perhaps from as grandchild I suspect nobody knows your work better than I do I've read it many times not once not twice at least three times everything you've written and the problem is it's a kind of quicksilver you very hard to grasp a point and hold you to it so we're going to try here to to see whether we can hold you to a point and then you argue with me the point I have no problem with that uh your name please Sten banel okay Mr banel referred to cherry-picking and handful of quotes now it's true that when you wrote your first book on the Palestinian refugee question you only had a few lines on this issue of transfer four pages yeah in the first book in the first book four pages maybe before you know I'm not going to quarrel my memory is not clear we're talking about 40 years ago I read it I read it but then I read other things by you okay and you were taken to task of my memories correct that you hadn't adequately documented the claims of transfer let me allow me to finish and I thought that was a reasonable challenge because it was an unusual usual claim for a mainstream Israeli historian to say as you did in that first book that from the very beginning transfer figured prominently in Zionist thinking that wasn't unusual if you read Anita shapira shapira you read chapai heit that was an unusual acknowledgement by you and then I found it very impressive that in that revised version of your first book you devoted 25 pages to copiously documenting the salience of transfer in Zionist thinking and in fact you used a very provocative and resonant phrase you said that transfer was inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism we're not talking about circumstantial factors a war Arab hostility you said it's inevitable and inbuilt into Zionism now as I said so we won't be accused of cherry-picking those were 25 very densely argued pages and then in an interview and I could cite several quotes but I'll choose one you said removing a population was needed let's look at the words without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established now you were the one again I was very surprised when I read your book here I'm referring to righteous victims I was very surprised when I came to that page 37 where you wrote that territorial displacement and dispossession was the CH Chief motor of Arab resistance to Zionism territorial displacement and dispossession were the chief motor of Arab resistance Des Zionism so you then went on to say because the Arab population rationally feared territorial displacement and dispossession it of course opposed Zionism that say normal as Native Americans opposing the euroamerican Manifest Destiny in the history of our own country because they understood it would be at their expense it was inbuilt and inevitable and so now for you to come along and say that it all happened just because of the war that otherwise the zionists made all these plans for a happy minority to live there that simply does not gel it does not cohere it is not reconcilable with what you yourself have written it was inevitable and inbuilt now in other situations you've said that's true but I think it was a greater good to establish a Jewish State at the expense of the uh indigenous population that's another kind of argument that was Theodore Roosevelt's argument in our own country he said we don't want the whole of North America to remain a squalid refuge for these wigwams and teps we have to get rid of them and make this a great country but he didn't deny that it was inbuilt and inevitable I think you've made your point first I'll take up something that mu said he said that the nakba was inevitable as have you and predictable no no no I I've never said that it was inevitable and predictable only because the Arabs assaulted the Jewish community and state in 1947 48 had there been no assault there probably wouldn't have been a refugee problem there's no reason for a refugee problem to have occurred expulsions to have occurred a dispossession massive dispossession to occur these occurred as a result of War now Norman said that I said that transfer was inbuilt into Zionism in one way or another and this is certainly true in order to buy land they had the Jews bought tracts of land on which some Arabs sometimes lived sometimes they bought tracts of land on which they weren't Arab Villages but sometimes they bought land on which they were Arabs and according to ottoman law and the British at least in the initial a year years of the the British mandate the law said that the people who bought the land could do what they liked with the people who didn't own the land who were basically squatting on the land which is the Arab tenant Farmers which is we're talking about a very small number actually of Arabs who were displaced as a result of land purchases in the automon period or the Mandate period but there was dispossession in one way they didn't possess the land they didn't own it but they were removed from the land and this did happen in Zionism and there's if you like an inevitability in Zionist ideology of buying tracts of land and starting to work at yourself and settle it with your own people and so on that made sense but what we're really talking about is what happened in 47 48 and in 4748 the Arabs started a war and actually people pay for their mistakes and the Palestinians have never actually agreed to pay for their mistakes they make mistakes they attack they suffer as a a result and we see something similar going on today in GA in the Gaza Strip they do something terrible they kill 1200 Jews they abduct 250 women and children and babies and um old people and whatever and then they start screaming please save us from what we did because the Jews are counterattacking and this is what happened then and this is what's happening now there's something fairly similar in the situation here expulsion and this is important Norman you should pay attention to this you did raise that expulsion transfer were never policy of the Zionist movement before 47 it doesn't exist in a Zionist platforms of the various political parties of the Zionist organization of the Israeli state of the Jewish agency nobody would have actually made it into policy because it was always a large minority if there were people who wanted it always a large minority of Jewish politicians and leaders would have said no this is immoral we cannot start a state on the basis of an expulsion so it was never adopted and actually was never adopted as policy even in 48 even though Boran wanted as few Arabs in the course of the war staying in the Jewish state after they attacked it he didn't want this loyal citizen staying there because they wouldn't have been loyal citizens but this made sense in the war itself but the movement itself and its political parties never accepted it it's true that in 1937 when the British as part of the proposal by the peel commission um to divide the country into two states one Arab one Jewish which the Arabs of course rejected a appeal also recommended that the Arabs most of the Arabs in the Jewish state to be should be transferred because otherwise if they stayed and were disloyal to the emerging Jewish State this would cause endless disturbances Warfare killing and so on a so Boran and whitesman latched onto this proposal by the F most famous America democracy in the world the British democracy when they proposed the idea of transfer side by side with the idea of partition because it made sense um and they said well if the British say so we should also advocated but they never actually tried to pass it as Zionist policy and they fairly quickly stopped even talking about transfer after 1938 so just to clarify what you're saying is that uh 40 7 was an offensive War not a defensive War by the Arabs yes by the Arabs yeah and you're also saying that there was never a top down policy of expulsion yes just to clarify the point if I understood you correctly um you're making you're making the claim that transfer expulsion and so on was was in fact a very localized phenomenon result resulting from individual land purchases um and that if I understand you correctly you're also making the claim um that the idea that a Jewish State requires a um removal or overwhelming reduction of the non-jewish population was if the Arabs are attacking you yes but but that let's say prior to 1947 it would be your claim um that the idea that a significant reduction or wholesale removal of the a population was not part of of Zionist thinking well I I think there's two problems with that um I think what you're saying about localized uh disputes is correct but I also think that um uh there is a whole literature that demonstrates um that transfer was envisioned by Zionist leaders on a much broader scale than simply individual land purchases in other words it's it it went Way Beyond we need to remove these tenants so that we can form this land the idea was we can't have a state where all these Arabs remain and we have to get rid of them and the second I think impediment to to that view is that long before the UN General Assembly convened um to address the question of Palestine Palestinian and Arab and other leaders as well had been warning at infinitum that the purpose of the Zionist movement is not just to establish a Jewish state but to establish an exclusivist uh Jewish State and that transfer Force displacement um uh was fundamental um uh to that uh project and just respond to um uh sorry was it bonell or with a B yeah yeah um you made the point that um uh the the problem here is that people don't recognize is that the first and last result for the Arabs is always War I think there's a problem with that I think um you might do well to recall um the 1936 general strike conducted by pales Ians um at the beginning of the Revolt which at the time was the longest recorded uh general strike in history um you may want to consult um the book uh published last year by Lori Allen a history of false hope which discusses in great detail the consistent engagement by Palestinians their leaders their Elites their diplomats and so on with all these International committees if we look at today the Palestinians are once again going to the international court of justice um they're consistently trying to persuade uh the chief prosecutor of the international criminal court to um do his job um they have launched widespread uh boycott campaigns so of course the Palestinians have engaged in um uh military resistance but I think the suggestion that this has always been their first and Last Resort and that they have somehow spurned Civic action spurned diplomacy I I think really has no basis uh in reality I'll respond to that and then a question for Norm to take into account I think when he answers Benny because I am curious obviously uh I have fresher eyes on this and I'm a newcomer to this Arena versus the three of you guys for sure um a claim that gets brought up a lot has to do with the inevitability of transfer in Zionism or the idea that as soon as the Jews envisioned a state and Palestine they knew that it would involve some Mass transfer of population perhaps a mass expulsion um I'm sure we'll talk about plan Dall or Plan D at some point the issue that I run into is while you can find quotes from leaders while you can find maybe desires expressed in Diaries I feel like it's hard to truly ever know if there would have been Mass transfer in the face of Arab peace because I feel like every time there was a huge deal on the table that would have had a sizable Jewish and Arab population living together the Arabs would reject it out of hand so for instance when we say that transfer was inevitable when we say that zionists would have never accepted you know a sizable Arab population how do you explain the acceptance of the 47 partition plan that would have had a huge Arab population living in the Jewish state is your contention that after the acceptance of that after the establishment of that state that Jews would have slowly started to expel all of these Arab citizens from their country or how do you explained that in lcan couple years later that Israel was willing to formally Annex the Gaza Strip and make 200,000 or so people those citizens but but I'm I'm just curious how how do we get this idea of Zionism always means Mass transfer when there were times at least early on in the history of Israel and and a little bit before it where Israel would have accepted a state that would have had a massive Arab population in it is your yeah is your idea that they would have just slowly expelled them afterwards or is that question to me or Norm either one I'm just curious with the incorporation of the answer yeah um there is some misunderstandings here so let's try to clarify that number one it was the old historians who would point to the fact in Professor Morris's terminology the old historians what he called not real historians he called them chroniclers not real historians it was the old Israeli historians who denied the centrality of transfer in Zionist thinking it was then Professor moris who contrary to Israel's historic historian establishment who said now you remind me it's four pages but it came at the end of the book it was no no it's at the beginning of the book transfer yes transfer is dealt with in four pages at the beginning of my first book on the palan refugee problem it's a fault of my memory but the point still stands it was Professor Maris who introduced this idea in what you might call A way yeah but I didn't say every the central to Des Des experiment or experience you're saying centrality I never said it was Central I said it was there the idea it's by the way it's okay to respond back and forth this is great and also just a quick question if I may you're using quotes from from Benny from Professor Morris uh it's also okay to say those quotes do not reflect the cont of so like if we go back if you know to quotes we've said in the past and both here have written the three of you have written on this topic a lot is we should be careful and just admit like well yeah well just well real quick just to be clear that the contention is that Norm is quoting a part and saying that this was the entire reason for this whereas Benny saying it's a part of I'm not quoting a part I'm quoting 25 Pages where Professor moris was at Great pains to document the claim that appeared in those early four pages of his book now you say it never became part of the official Zionist platform never became part of policy F we're also asked well this is true why did that happen why did that happen it's because it's a very simple fact which everybody understands ideology doesn't operate in vacuum there are real world practical problems you can't just take an ideology and superimpose it on a political reality and turn it into a fact it was the British mandate there was significant Arab resistance to Zionism and that resistance was based on the fact as you said the Fe Fe of territorial displacement and dispossession so you couldn't very well expect the Zionist movement to come out in neon lights and announce hey we're going to be expelling you the first chance we get can that's not realistic okay let me respond look you said you've said it a number of times that um um the Arabs from fairly early on in the be in the conflict from the 1890s or the early 1900s said the Jews intend to expel us this doesn't mean that it's true it means that some Arabs said this maybe believing it was true maybe using it as a political instrument to gain support to mobilize Arabs against the Zionist experiment but the fact is transfer did not occur before 1947 um and Arabs later said and then and since then have said that the Jews want to build a third temple on the Temple mount um as if that's what really the the mainstream of Zionism has always wanted and always strived for but this is nonsense it's something that kusini used to use as a way to mobilize masses for the cause using religion as as the way to get them to to join join him um the fact that Arabs said that they the Zionist want to dispossess us doesn't mean it's true it just means that there some Arabs thought that maybe and maybe said it since and maybe insincerely Professor Morris later it became a self-fulfilling prophecy this is true Arabs attacked the Jews Professor Maris I read through your stuff even yesterday I was looking through righteous victim you should read other things you're wasting your time no no actually no I do read other things but I don't consider it a waste of time to read you not at all um you say that this wasn't inherent in Zionism now would you all agree that Ben David benorian was a Zionist a z major Zionist right would you agree Ken vitman was a Zionist yeah okay I believe they were I believe they took their ideology seriously it was the first generation just like with the Bolsheviks the first generation was committed to an idea by the 1930s it was just pure raop politic the IDE went out the window the first generation I have no doubt about their convictions okay they were zionists transfer was inevitable and inbu in Zionism you keep repeating the same because I have as I said Benny Mr moris I have a problem reconciling what you're saying it either was incidental or it was deeply entrenched here I read it's deeply entrenched two very resonant words inevitable and inbuilt deeply entrenched I never wrote I'm not sure it's something you just invented but but in inable and the idea let me concede let me concede something the idea of transfer was there Israel zangvil a British Zionist talked about it early on in the century even Herzel in some way talked about transferring according to your 25 Pages everybody talked about on we keep bringing up this line from the 25 pages and the four pages uh you know we're lucky to have Benny in front of us right now we don't need to go to the quotes at like we can legitimately ask how Central is expulsion to Zionism uh in its early version of Zionism and what whatever Zionism is today and how much power uh influence the Zionism and ideology have in Israel and like influence the Phil the philosophy the ideology of Zionism have on Israel today the Zionist movement up to 1948 Zionist ideology was Central to the the whole Zionist experience the whole Enterprise up to 1948 and I think Zionist ideology was also important um in the first Decades of Israel's existence um slowly the the the um hold of Zionism like if you like like like bolshevism held the Soviet Union gradually faded and a lot of Israelis today think in terms of individual success and then the capitalism and all all sorts of things which nothing to do with Zionism but Zionism was very important but what I'm saying is that the idea of transfer wasn't the core of Zionism the idea of Zionism was to save the Jews who had been vastly persecuted a in in Eastern Europe and incidentally in the Arab world the Muslim world for centuries um and eventually ending up with the Holocaust the idea of Zionism was to save the Jewish people by establishing a state or reestablishing a Jewish State on the ancient Jewish homeland which is something the Arabs today even deny that there were Jews in Palestine or the land of Israel a 2,000 years ago Arafat famously said what Temple was there on Temple Mount maybe it was in Nablus which of course is nonsense but but um they had a connection strong connection for thousands of years to the land to which they wanted to return and returned there they found that on the land lived hundreds of thousands of Arabs and the question was how to accommodate the vision of a Jewish state in Palestine alongside the existence of these um um Arab masses living on who were indigenous in fact to The Land by that stage um and the idea of partition because they couldn't live together because the Arabs didn't want to live together with the Jews and I think the Jews also didn't want to live together in one state with Arabs in general the idea of partition was the thing which um the zionists accepted okay we can we can only get a small part of Palestine the Arabs will get in 37 most of Palestine in 1947 the the ratios were changed but we can we can live side by side with each other in a partitioned Palestine and this was the essence of it the idea of transfer was there but it was never adopted by as policy but in 1947-48 the Arabs attacked trying to destroy essentially the Jewish the Zionist Enterprise and the emerging Jewish State and a um the reaction was a transfer in some way a not as policy but this is what happened on the battlefield and this is also what Boran at some point began to want as well right well you know one of the first um books on this issue uh I read uh when I was still in high school because my my late father had it was a Diaries of Theodore Herzel and I think you know Theodore Herzel of course was was the founder of of the Contemporary Zionist movement and I think if you read that it's very clear for Herzel the model upon which the Zionist movement would uh would proceed his model was Cil Ro roads has um I think you know roads from what I recall correct me if I'm wrong has quite a prominent place in uh herzl's Diaries I think Herzel was also corresponding uh with him and seeking his support cesil rhods of course was um uh was the uh British um colonialist after whom the former white minori regime in uh in rudia uh was named and Herzel also says explicitly in his diaries that it is essential um to remove uh the existing population from Palestine can I respond to this in a moment please he says we shall have to spear the penniless population across the borders and procure employment for them elsewhere or something and Israel zil who you mentioned a land without a people for a people without a land they knew damn well it wasn't a people a land without a people um I'll continue but but please go just to this there is one small diary entry in herz's vast volumes yeah five volumes there's one paragraph which actually mentions the idea of transfer there are people who I think that Herzel was actually pointing to South America when he was talking about that the Jews were going to move to Argentina and then they would try and a buy out or buy off or Spirit the the penniless natives um to make way for Jewish settlement maybe he wasn't even talking about the Arabs in that particular passage that's the argument of some people maybe he was but the point is it it has only a one 100th of a 1% of the Diary which is devoted to the subject it's not a central idea in Herzel in herz's thinking the what Herzel wanted and this is what's important not RADS I don't think he was the model Herzel wanted to create a liberal Democratic Western State in Palestine for the Jews that's that was the idea not some Imperial Enterprise serving some Imperial Master which is what rhs was about but to have a Jewish state which was modeled on the western democracies in in Palestine and this incidentally was more or less what whitesman and Boran Boran wanted they Boran was more of a socialist whitesman was more of a liberal a um Westerner but they wanted to establish a Social Democratic or liberal state in Palestine and they both envisioned through most of the years of their activity that there would be an Arab minority in that Jewish State it's true that benguan strive to have as small as possible an Arab minority in the Jewish State because he knew that if you want a Jewish majority state that that would be necessary but it's not something which they were willing to translate into actual policy uh just a quick pause to mention that for people who are not familiar The Herzel we're talking about a century ago and everything we've been talking about has been mostly 1948 and before yes just one clarification on herzl's Diaries I mean the other thing that I recall from those Diaries is he was um he was very preoccupied with in fact getting great power patronage seeing Palestine um the Jewish state in Palestine I think his words an outpost of civilization against barbarism yes in other words very much um seeing his project as a prox as a proxy for Western imperialism in the Middle East right word not proxy he wanted to establish a Jewish state which would be independent to get that he hoped that he would be able to Garner support from major Imperial Powers including including the ottoman Sultan he tried to cultivate I just want to respond to a point you made earlier which was that people expressed their rejection of the partition resolution um on the grounds that it gave the majority of the of Palestine to the Jewish Community which formed only a third um whereas in fact uh if I understood you correctly you're saying the Palestinians and the Arabs would have rejected any partition resolution yeah I think a couple things that one they would have rejected any two a lot of that land given was in the nigab it was pretty terrible land at the time and three the land that would have been partitioned to Jews I think would have been um I think I saw it was like 500,000 ER would have been 500,000 Jews 400,000 Arabs and I think like 80,000 bedwin would have been there so the the state would have been I think you raised a valid point um because I think the Palestinians did reject the partition of their Homeland in principle and I think the fact that um the United Nations General Assembly then awarded the majority of their Homeland um uh to the Zionist movement only added insult to injury I mean uh um uh one doesn't have to sympathize with the Palestinians um to recognize that they have now been a stateless people for 75 years can you name any country yours for example or yours that would be prepared to give 55% 25% 10% of your country to the Palestinians of course not and so um the issue was not the existence of Jews in Palestine um they had been there for centuries and of course they had ties to Palestine and particularly to Jerusalem and and other places going back centuries if not Millennia um but the idea of establishing an exclusively Jewish State at the expense of those who are already living there I think it was right to reject that and I don't think we can look back now 75 years later and say well you should have accepted losing 55% of your Homeland because you ended up losing 78% of it the addition and the remaining 22% was occupied in 1967 that's that's not how things work yeah um and I can I can imagine I can imagine an American rejecting giving 10% of the United States to the Palestinians and if that rejection leads to war and you lose half your country I doubt that 50 years from now you're going to say well maybe I should have accepted that sure so I like this answer more than what I usually feel like I'm hearing when it comes to the Palestinian rejection of the 47 partition plan because sometimes I feel like a weird switch happens to where the Arabs in the area are actually presented as entirely pragmatic people who are simply doing a calculation and saying like well we're losing 55% of our land Jews are only maybe onethird of the people here and we've got 45 and N the math doesn't work basically but it wasn't a math problem I think like you said it was a matter of principle it was an ideology problem no it was a matter of principle yeah ideologically driven that that they as a as a people have a right to or entitled to this land that they've never actually had an independent state on that they've never had even a guarantee of an independent state on that they've never actually ruled a govern that last point is actually not correct because for all its Injustice um the mandate system recognized Palestine as a class a mandate which provisionally recognized the independence of of that territory of what would emerge from that territory but not thees it was provisionally recognized but not but the the territory itself was but not of the Palestinian people to have a right or a guaranteed to a government that was a British Mandate of Palestine not the British Mandate of Israel the word exclusive which you keep using is nonsense the state which benan envisioned would be a Jewish majority State as they accepted the 1947 partition resolution as Steven said that included 400,000 plus Arabs in a state which would have 500,000 Jews so the idea of exclusivity wasn't anywhere in the air at all among the Zionist leaders in 4748 they wanted a Jewish majority state but were willing to accept a state which had 40% Arabs that's one point the second thing is the Palestinians may have regarded the land of Palestine as their Homeland but so did the Jews it was the homeland of the Jews as well the problem was the Arabs were unable and remain to this day unable to recognize that for the Jews that is their Homeland as well and the problem then is how do you share this Homeland either with one bational state or separate this partitioned into two states the problem is that the Arabs have always rejected both of these ideas the Homeland belongs to the Jews as Jews feel as much as it does not more than for the Arabs I would say for the Jews it's the Jewish I would also real quick I just want for both of you guys because I haven't heard these questions answered I really want these questions to be I'm just so curious how to make sense of them um it was correctly brought up that I believe that benan had um I think Schmo benam describes it as an obsession with getting validation or support from Western States um Great Britain and then a couple decades later explains the su's war the's crisis exactly correct that was one of the major motivators the idea to work with Britain and France on a military operation but then the question again I go back to if that is true if beneran if the early uh Israel saw themselves as a western Fashion Nation how could we possibly imagine that they would have engaged in the transfer of some 400,000 Arabs after accepting the partition plan would that not have completely and totally destroyed their legitimacy in the eyes of the entire Western world would not have been how not well first of all I think that that the Zionist leadership's acceptance of um the partition resolution um and and I think you may written about this that they accepted it because it provided International endorsement of the the legitimacy of the principle of Jewish statehood and they didn't accept the borders um and in fact uh later expanded the borders second of all the borders the borders they accepted the UN partition resolution borders and all they you can say that some of the zionists deep in their hearts had the the idea that maybe incl to including their most senior leaders who said so and I think you've quoted them they grudgingly accepted what the United Nation the world Community had said this is what you're going to get and and second of all I mean removing dark people darker people it's dark it's inic are as dark as Arabs it's intrinsic to Western history so the idea that Americans or Brits or the French would have an issue with I mean French had been doing it in Algeria for decades the Americans have been doing it in North America for centuries so how would Israel forcibly displacing um Palestinians somehow besmer um uh Israel in the eyes of the West even in the 1944 resolution of the labor party and at the time even Bertrand Russell was a member of the labor party it endorsed transfer of Arabs out of Palestine as m pointed out that was a deeply entrenched idea in Western thinking that there was nothing uh it doesn't in any way contradict or violate or breach any moral values to displace uh the Palestinian population now I do believe there's a legitimate question had it been the case as you said Professor Mars that the zionists wanted to create a happy state with a Jewish majority but a large Jewish minority and if by virtue of immigration like in our own country in our own country given the current trajectories nonwhites will become the majority population in our United States quite soon and according to democratic principles we have to accept that so if that were the case I would say maybe there's an argument that had there been Mass Jew Jewish immigration changed the demographic balance in Palestine and therefore uh Jews became the majority you can make an argument in the abstract that the indigenous Arab population should have been accepting of that just as whites in the United States quote unquote whites have to be accepting of the fact that the demographic majority is Shifting to non-whites in our own country but that's not what Zionism was about I did write my doctrinal dissertation on Zionism and I don't want to get now bogged down in abstract ideas but as I suspect you know most theorists of nationalism say there are two kinds of nationalism one is a nationalism based on citizenship you become a citizen you're integral to the country that's sometimes called political nationalism and then there's another kind of nationalism and that says the state should not belong to its citizens it should belong to an ethnic group each ethnic group should have its own State it's usually called the German romantic idea of nationalism Zionism is squarely in the Jew German romantic idea that was the whole point of Zionism we don't want to be bundists and be one more ethnic minority in Russia we don't want to become citizens and just become a Jewish people in England or friends we want our own State like like the arab3 states no wait let's before we get to the Arabs let's get let's stick to the Jews for a moment or the zionists we want our own State and in that concept of wanting your own State the minority at best lives on sufferance and at worst gets expelled that's the logic of the German romantic Zionist idea of a state that's why they're zionists now I personally have shied away from using the word Zionism ever since I finished my doctoral dissertation because painful because as I said I don't believe it's the operative ideology today it's like talking about bism and referring to Kush I doubt Kush could have spelled bik but for the period we're talking about they were zionists they were committed to their exclusive state with with a minority living on sufferance or at worst expelled that was their ideology and I really feel there's a problem with your happy vision of these Western Democrats like vitman and they wanted to live peacefully with the Arabs vitman described the exposion in 1948 as quote the miraculous clearing of the land that doesn't sound like somebody shedding Too Many Tears at the loss of the indigenous population let me just respond to the word unsuffer the unsuffer I don't agree with I think that's wrong the Jewish State came into being in 1948 it had a population which was 20% Arab when it came into being after Arab refugees many of them had become refugees but 20% remained in the country 20% of Israel's population at Inception in 1949 was Arab 80% went missing no no no no I we talking about what remained in Palestine Israel after it was created um the 20% who lived in Israel received citizenship and all the rights of Israelis except of course the right to serve in the Army which they didn't want to um and they have Supreme Court justices they have knesset members they enjoy basically under laws until 1966 for period sure they lived under they didn't immed no no wait a second at the beginning at the beginning it's not fantasy at the beginning they received citizenship could vote in elections for their own people and they were put into Parliament um but in the first years the Israeli the Jewish majority suspected that maybe the Arabs would be disloyal because they had just tried to destroy the Jewish State then they dropped the military government and they became fully equal citizens um so if the whole idea was they must have a state without Arabs this didn't happen in 49 and it didn't happen in the you say Professor Morris then why did you say without a population exposion a Jewish state would not have been established because the you're missing the first section of that paragraph was they were being assaulted by the Arabs and as a result a Jewish State could not have come into being unless there had also been an expulsion of the population which was trying to kill nor I'm officially forbidding you referencing that again hold on a second wait uh we responded to it so the the main point you're making we have to take B's word is like there was uh a war and that's the reason why he made that statement I think just one last point on this I I remember reading your book when it first came out and and and reading you know one incident after the other and and one example after the other and then getting to the conclusion where you said um uh the nakba was a product of War not design I think re ex and I remember reacting almost in in in in shock to that that I felt you had mobilized overwhelming evidence that it was a product of design not war and I think our discussion today very much uh reflects let's say the dissonance uh between the evidence and the conclusion you don't feel that that the um uh the research that you have conducted and published demonstrates that it was in fact um inherent and inbuilt and inevitable um and I think the point that Norman I are making is is that you're own historical research together with that of others indisputably demonstrates that it does I think that's a fundamental disagreement we're having here can I wait yeah can I actually respond to that because this is actually uh I think this is emblematic of the entire conversation um I watched a lot of norms interviews uh and conversations in preparation for this and I hear normal say this all over and over and over again I only deal in facts I don't deal in hypotheticals I only deal in facts I only deal in facts and that seems to be the case except for when the facts are completely and totally contrary to the particular point Point you're trying to push the idea that Jews would have out of hand rejected any state that had Arabs on it or always had a plan of exposion is just betrayed by the acceptance of the 47 partition I don't think you understand politics did I just say that there is a Chasm that separates your ideology from the limits and constraints imposed by politics and reality now Professor Mars I suspect would agree that the Zionist movement from fairly early on was committed to the idea of a Jewish State I am aware of only one major study probably written 40 years ago the the bational idea in mandatory Palestine by a woman I forgot her name now you'll remember her I'm trying to yeah okay but you know the book I think so yeah she is the only one who tried to persuasively argue that the Zionist movement was actually not formally actually committed to the bational idea but most historians of the subject agree the Zionist movement was committed to the idea of a Jewish State having written by doctoral dissertation on the topic I was confirmed in that idea because Professor chsky who was my closest friend for about 40 years was very committed to the idea that b nationalism was the dominant Trend in Zionism I could not agree with I couldn't go with him there but Professor moris you are aware that until the builtmore resolution in 1942 the Zionist movement never declared it was for a Jewish State why because it was politically impossible at the moment until 1942 there is your ideology there are your convictions there are your operative plans and there's also separately what you say in public the Zionist movement couldn't say in public we're expelling all the Arabs they can't say that and they couldn't even say we support a Jewish State until 1942 you're conflating two things that the The zionists Wanted a Jewish State correct that didn't mean expulsion of the Arabs it's not the same thing they wanted a Jewish state with a Jewish majority but they were willing as it turned out both in 37 and in 40 47 and subsequently to have an Arab minority transfer a large Arab minor there was a trans they were willing to have a large Arab minority in the country and they ended up with a large Arab minority in the country 20% of the population in 49 was Arab and they ended up for about 5 minutes before they were expelled they agreed to end up till 47 and then they were gone by March 1949 what happened in between the rejection of the partition plan and the expulsion of the Arabs the Arabs launched the war well yeah I mean like it's not it wasn't random like there's a potential that agree it wasn't random I totally agree with that it was by Design youand you can say that but in this case the facts betray you there was no Arab acceptance of anything that would have allowed for a Jewish state to exist number one and number two I think that it's entirely possible given how things happen after war that this exact same conflict could have played out and an explosion would have happened without any ideology at play that there was a people that disagreed on who had territorial rights to a land there was a massive war afterwards and then a bunch of their friends invaded after to reinforce the idea that the Jewish people in this case couldn't have a state there could have been a transfer regardless anything could have been that's not what history is about history is about Palestinian rection is to any peace deal over over I said when the ball was thrown into the court of the United Nations they were faced with a practical problem and I for one am not going to try to adjudicate the Rights and Wrongs from the beginning I do not believe that if territorial displacement and dispossession was inherent in the Zionist project I do not believe it can be a legitimate political Enterprise now you might say that's speaking from 2022 or 202 now okay but we have to recognize that from nearly the beginning for perfectly obvious reasons having nothing to do with anti-semitism anti- westernism anti-europeanism but because no people that I am aware of would voluntarily seed its country all that sold voluntarily you can perfectly understand native American resistance to Euro colonialism you can perfectly well understanded without any anti-europeanism anti-h ism anti- christianism they didn't want to seed their country to Invaders that's completely understandable you're minimizing the anti-semitic element you minim in Arab Nation all your books you minimized no no no the husseini was an anti-site the leader of the Palestinian national movement in the 30s and 40s was an anti-site this was one of the things which drove him and also drove him in the end to work in Berlin for Hitler for four years with Nazi giving Nazi propaganda to the Arab world calling on the Arabs to murder the Jews that's what he did in World War II that's the leader of the Palestinian Arab national movement and he wasn't alone he wasn't alone why is it have you read your book righteous victims you can read it and read it and read it and read it as I have you will find barely a word about the Arabs being motivated by anti-Semitism it exists though I didn't say it doesn't exist you agree that it exists hey I don't know a single non-jew who doesn't Harbor anti-semitic talking about Arabs now yeah but I don't know anybody that's just part of the human condition anti-Semitism among the Arabs so Professor Mars here's my problem I didn't see that in your righteous victims even when you talked about the first in father and you talked about the second into F and you talked about how there was a lot of influence by Hamas the Islamic movement you even stated that there was a lot of anti-Semitism in those movements but then you went on to say but of course at bottom it was about the occupation it wasn't about and I've read it yeah yeah but you're moving from different I'm notes across the ages talk about your whole book The began the one talking about I looked and looked and looked for evidence of this anti-Semitism as being a chief motor of Arab resistance to P Zionism I didn't see it you like did he make that claim I don't remember the word Chief it's it's one of the element very binary yes binary please don't give me this postmodernism binary you're the one you are thinking in terms of you're the one that said the do you have your book here talk about 137 talk in black and white you're talking in black and white Concepts when history is much grayer lots of things happen because of lots of reasons not one or the other and and you don't you don't seem to see that can I ask to because it's for them to talk to to very quick question what was what do you think the ideal solution was on the Arab side from 47 what would they have preferred and what would happened and then then the second one what would have happened if Jews would have lost the war in 48 what do you think would have happened to the Israeli population Jewish population I think the the Palestinians and the Arabs uh were explicit that they wanted a unitary I think Federal uh State and and they made their submissions to uh unscop uh they made their um uh appeals at the UN General Assembly what do you mean by Unitarian Federal I don't get that they wanted an Arab State they wanted Palestine to be an Arab State simply the word unitary federal they wanted Palestine Arab an exclusively Arab State no wasn't an no wasn't an exclusively Arab State I think we have to distinguish between Palestinian and Arab opposition to a Jewish state in Palestine on the one hand and um Palestinian and Arab attitudes to um Jewish existence in Palestine there's a fundamental difference the leader of the movement said that all the Jews who had come since 1917 and that's the majority of the Jews in Palestine 1947 shouldn't be there they shouldn't be citizens and they shouldn't be there4 I'm not also it's true I can understand the sentiment but I think it's wrong but also you you we agree on I also you guys you used the words earlier that it was Supremacy and exclusivity that the Zion I want to answer your question um as you husseini did say that and I'm sure there was a very substantial uh body of Palestinian Arab public opinion that endorsed that um but by the same token I think um uh unitary Arab State as you call it or a Palestinian State could have been established with arrangements with guarantees um to ensure the security and rights of of both communities how that would work in detail had had been um uh discussed and proposed but never uh resolved and again I think you know Jewish fears about what would have second Holocaust that's what we no I I think that was the Jewish fear a second Holocaust that that may well have been the Jewish fear it was an unfounded uh Jewish fear it was unfounded of course it was unfounded what about like in 48 and you really think you really think that the Palestinians had they won the war were going to import ovens and crematoria from Germany but there were programs across in almost every single Arab state where there were Jews living after after 48 after 56 after 67 there were always progrms there were always flights from Jews from those countries to Israel afterward I think I wouldn't I wouldn't say there were always pograms in every Arab State I think there was flight of of um uh Arab Jews for multiple reasons in some cases for precisely the reasons you say if you look at the Jewish community in Algeria for example their flight had virtually nothing to do with um uh the Arab Israel conflict the issue of of Algerian Jews was that the French gave them citizenship during their colonial rule of Algeria and they increasingly became identified uh with French rule and when Algeria became independent and um all the French um ended up uh uh leaving out of fear or out of disappointment or out of whatever um the Jews were identified as French rather than Algerian this is a bit of a red hairing there were programs in the Arab countries in bahin even where there's almost no Jews there was a prog in 1947 there was a pram Aleppo in 1947 I'm not denying any of that history killings of Jews in Iraq and Egypt in 1948 49 so but the Arabs the Jews basically fled the Arab states not for multiple reasons they fled because they felt that the governments there and the societies am Amid Amid which they had lived for hundreds of years no longer want look without without getting into the details I think we can both agree that ultimately a clear majority of Arab Jews who believed that after having lived in these countries for for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries for centuries if not Millennia um came to the unfortunate conclusion that their situation had become untenable yes um I also think um that we can both agree that this had never been an issue prior to Zionism and the emergence of the state of isra prior to Zionism GRS didn't begin with Zionism in the Arab world the issue is is is is the point I raised which is whether these communities had ever come to a collective conclusion that their position had become untenable in this part of the world no they were Arab Jews well because untable meant there was no alternative but with the creation of Israel there was an alternative right a place where they could go and not be discriminated against or live as second class citizens or be subject to Arab majority States I I also think it's interesting that like when you analyze the um the flight of Jewish people and I've seen this that there it's not it wasn't just I agree with you it wasn't just a mass exposion from all the Arab states there were definitely push factors there were also pull factors now I don't know how you guys feel about the knba but when the analysis the nakba comes in again it's back to that well that was actually just a top- down exposion um you know the retreat of wealthy Arab people in the 30s didn't matter uh any of the messaging from the surrounding Arab states didn't matter it was just an expulsion from Jewish people or people running from their lives from Jewish massacres um again it's like that I feel like it's a SEL a stive critical analis the term Jewish here because it wasn't the you know the Jews of England or the Soviet say jewi because prior to 48 say Israeli you I think we should I think it's useful to to say um referred to zionists before 1948 and Israelis after 48 we don't need to implicate um well sure but but the Jewish people that were being attacked in Arab states weren't zionists they were just Jews living there just comment on that I was rereading uh schlomo bami's last book and he does at the end discuss at some length the whole issue of the refugee question bearing on the so-called peace process and on the question of 48 and the Arab immigration if you allow me let me just quote him Israel is particularly fond of the awkwardly full FSE symmetry she makes between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced immigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries following the creation of the state of Israel as if it were quote an unplanned exchange of UNP populations unquote and then Mr benami for those of you who are listening he was Israel's former foreign minister and he's an influential historian in his own right he says in fact envoys from the mosad and the Jewish agency worked underground in Arab countries and Iran to encourage Jews to go to Israel more importantly for many Jews in Arab states the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millennial aspirations it represented the consummation of a dream to take part in Israel's Resurgence as a nation so this idea that they were all expelled after 1948 it's that's one area Professor Maris I defer to expertise that's one of my credos in life I don't know the Israeli literature but as it's been translated in English there is very little solid scholarship on what happened in 194 48 in the Arab countries and which caused the Jews to leave Arab Jews the Arab Jews right uh but uh shomo benami knows the literature he knows the scholarship he's a his yeah from morocc right so he knows from Iraq was written on this issue and they wrote that the Jews and the Arab lands were not pro zionists they weren't zionists at all certainly ai's family was anti and AI schlim when he was interviewed by Marin Rapaport on this question he said you simply cannot say that the Iraqi Jews were expelled it's just not true and he was speaking as an Iraqi Jew who left with his father family in 1948 they were pushed out they weren't expelled well that that's probably the right phrase they were pushed I think it's more complex than than that I think it was sorry I interrupted you no you're not interrupting me because I don't I I only know what's been translated into English and the English literature on the subject is very small and not scholarly now there may be an uh Hebrew literature I don't know but I was surprised that even schomo benami a stward of his state fair enough on this particular point he called it false symmetry no no step is right there was a pull and push mechanism in the departure of the Jews from the Arab lands post 48 but there was also a lot of push a lot of push that's that's indisputable there was p and on the point of agreement let on this one brief light of agreement let us wrap up with this uh topic of history and move on to modern day but before that I'm wondering if uh we can just say a couple of last words on this topic Stephen yeah I think that when you look at the behaviors of both parties uh in in the time period around 48 or especially 48 and earlier um there's this assumption that there was this huge built-in mechanism of Zionism and that it was going to be inevitable from the Inception of the first Zionist thought I I guess that appeared in herz's mind that there would be a mass violent population transfer of Arab Palestinians out of what would become the Israeli State uh I understand that there are some quotes that we can find that maybe seem to possibly support an idea that looks close to that but I think when you actually consult the record of what happened when you look at the populations the massive populations that Israel was willing to accept uh within what would be become their state borders their nation borders uh I just don't think that the historical record agrees with the idea that Zionist would have just never been okay living alongside Arab Palestinians uh but when you look at the other side Arabs would out of hand reject literally any deal that apportioned any amount of that land for any state relating to Jewish people or the Israeli people I think it was said even on the other end of the table that uh Arab Palestinians would have never accepted the Arabs would have never accepted any Jewish State whatsoever so it's interesting that on the ideology part where it's claimed that zionists are people of exclusion and Supremacy and expulsion uh we can find that in Diary entries but we can find that expressed in very real terms on the Arab side I think in all of their behavior around 48 and earlier where the goal was the destruction of the Israeli State um it would have been the dispossession of many Jewish people it probably would have been the exposion of a lot of them back to Europe and I think that very clearly plays out in the difference between the actions of the Arabs versus some diary entries of some Jewish leaders Benny well one thing which stood out and um I think mu made this point is that the Arabs had nothing to do with the Holocaust but then the world Community forced the Arabs to pay the price for the Holocaust that's the traditional Arab argument um this is slightly distorting the reality the Arabs in the 1930s did their utmost to prevent Jewish IM immigration from Europe and reaching Palestine which was the only Safe Haven available because America Britain France nobody wanted Jews anywhere and they were being persecuted in Central Europe and eventually would be massacred in large numbers so the Arab effort to pressure the British to prevent Jews reaching palestine's safe Shores contributed indirectly to the slaughter of many Jews in Europe because they couldn't get to anywhere and they couldn't get to Palestine because the Arabs were busy attacking Jews in Palestine and attacking the British to make sure they didn't allow Jews to reach this Safe Haven that's important the second thing is of course there's no point in belittling the fact that the Arab Palestinian Arab National movements leader husseini um worked for the Nazis in the 1940s he got a salary from the German foreign Ministry he raised troops among Muslims in Bosnia for the SS and he broadcast to the Arab world calling for the murder of the Jews in the Middle East this is what he did and the Arabs since then have been trying to whitewash Hussein's role um and not saying he was the instigator of the Holocaust but he did he helped helped the Arab the Germans along in in doing what they were doing and and supported them in doing that so there this can't be removed from the fact that the Arabs um as you say paid a price for the Holocaust but they also participated in various ways in helping it happen right I'll make two points um the first is um you mentioned ha husseini and his uh collaboration with the Nazis entirely legitimate point to raise but I think one can also say definitively had Haj am Al husseini never existed the Holocaust would have played out precisely certainly um as it did certainly as far as um Palestinian opposition to Jewish immigration to Palestine um during the 1930s is concerned it was of a different character than for example British and American um rejection of uh Jewish immigration they just didn't want Jews on their soil objectively it helped the Germans kill the Jews and the Palestinian case their opposition to Jewish immigration was to prevent the transformation of their Homeland into a Jewish state that would dispossess them and I think that's an important distinction to make um the other point I wanted to make is we've we've spent the past several hours talking about uh uh Zionism transfer and so on but I think there's a more fundamental aspect to this which is that um Zionism I think would have emerged and disappeared as yet one more utopian political project had it not been for the British um what the preeminent Palestinian historian wi khedi um has turned the British Shield because I think without the British sponsorship we wouldn't be having this discussion today um the British um uh sponsored Zionism for a very simple reason which is that during World War I uh the ottoman armies attempted to march on the Suz uh Canal Suz Canal was the jugular vein of uh the British Empire um you know between uh Europe and India and the British came to the conclusion that they needed to secure the suas canal from any threat and as the British have done so often in so many places how do you deal with this well you know you you bring in a uh foreign minority implant them amongst a hostile uh population and establish a protectorate over them I don't think um a Jewish state in Palestine had been part of br intentions and the bfor Declaration very specifically speaks about a Jewish National home in Palestine in other words a British protectorate um things ended up taking a different course um and I think the the the most important development was uh World War II and I think this had maybe less to do with the Holocaust and more to do with the effective bankruptcy of the United Kingdom uh during that war and its inability to sustain um its Global uh Empire it ended up giving up India ended up giving up uh Palestine and it's in that context I think that we need to see um uh the emergence of a uh of a Jewish state in Palestine and again a Jewish State means a state in which the Jewish Community enjoys um not only a demographic majority but an uncontested able demographic majority an uncontestable territorial uh hemony and an uncontestable political Supremacy and that is also why after 1948 the nent Israeli States confiscated I believe up to 90% of uh lands that had been previously owned um by Palestinians who became citizens of Israel it is why the new Israeli state imposed a military government on its population of Palestinian citizens between 1948 and 1966 um it is why the Israeli State effectively um reduced uh the Palestinians living within the Israeli State as citizens of the Israeli state to second class citizens on the one hand promoting Jewish nationalism and Jewish nationalist parties on the other hand doing everything within its power to suppress and eliminate Palestinian or Arab um uh nationalist movements and that's why today there's a consensus among all major human rights organizations that Israel is an apartheid state what the Israeli human rights organization bet selum describes a regime of Jewish Supremacy between the river and the Sea you're you're really tempting a response from the other side on on the last few sentences okay we'll talk about the claims of of apartheid and so on it's a fascinating discussion we need to have it uh nor on the question of the responsibility of the Palestinian Arabs for the Nazi holus direct or indirect I consider that an absurd claim uh as Gro said and I quoted him the entire Western World turned its back on the Jews to somehow focus on the Palestinians strikes me as completely ridiculous number two as M said there's a perfectly understandable reason why Palestinian Arabs wouldn't want Jews because in their minds and not irrationally these Jews intended to create a Jewish state which would quite likely have resulted in their exposion I'm a very generous person I've actually taken in a homeless person for two and a half years but if I knew in advance that that homeless person was going to try to turn me out of my apartment I would think 10,000 times before I took him in okay as far as the actual uh complicity of the Palestinian Arabs if you look at uh rul hilberg's three volum volume classic work the destruction of the European jury he has in those thousand plus pages one sentence one sentence on the role of the Muti of Jerusalem and that I think is probably an overstatement but we'll leave it aside the only two points I would make aside from the Holocaust point is number one I do think the transfer discussion is useful because it indicates that there was a rational reason behind the Arab resistance to Jewish or Zionist immigration to Palestine the fear of territorial displacement and dispossession and number two there are two issues one is the history and the second is being responsible for your words now some people accuse me of speaking very slowly and they're advised YouTube to turn up the speed twice to three times whenever I'm on one of the reasons I speak slowly is because I attach value to every word I say and it is discomforting disorienting where you have a person who's produced a voluminous Corpus rich in insight and rich in our kival sources who seems to disown each and every word that you pluck from that Corpus by claiming that it's either out of context or it's cherry picking words count and I agree with Lex everybody has the right to resend what they' have said in the past but what you cannot claim is that you didn't say what you said I'll stick to the history not the current propaganda 1917 the British the the Zionist movement began way before the British supported the Zionist movement for decades in 1917 the British jumped in and issued the balur Declaration supporting the emergence of a Jewish National home in Palestine which most people understood to mean eventual Jewish statehood in Palestine most people understood that in Britain and in is among the zionists and among the Arabs um but the British declared the balur Declaration or issued the balur Declaration not only because of Imperial self-interest and this is a what you're basically saying they had Imperial interests above for state which would protect the SE Canal from the East the British also were motivated by idealism and this incidentally is how balur described the reasoning behind issuing the Declaration and he said the West Western World Western Christendom owes the Jews a great debt both for giving a the the world and the West if you like a values social values as as embodied in the the Bible um social justice and all sorts of other things and the Christian world owes the Jews because it persecuted them for 2,000 years this debt we're now beginning to repay with the 1917 declaration favoring Zionism but it's also remembering that the Jews um weren't proxies or attached to the British um Imperial Endeavor they were happy to receive British support in 1917 and then subsequently when the British ruled Palestine for 20 30 years um but they weren't part of the British Imperial design or Mission they wanted a state for themselves the Jews happy to have the British support them happy today to have the Americans support his Isel but it's not because we're stoes or extensions of American Imperial interests um the British incidentally always described in Arab narratives of propaganda as consistent supporters of Zionism they weren't the first British rulers in Palestine 1917 1920 Herbert Samuel no before Herbert Samuel Samuel came in 1920 the British ruled there for three years previously and most of the leaders the British generals and so on who were in Palestine were anti-zionist and subsequently in the 20s and 30s the British occasionally um curbed Zionist immigration to Palestine and in 1939 switched horses and supported the Arab national movement and not Zionism they turned anti-zionist and basically said you Arabs will rule Palestine within the next 10 years this is what we're giving you by limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine a but the Arabs didn't actually understand what they were being given on a silver platter husseini again and he said no no we can't accept the British white paper of May 1939 which had given the Arabs everything they wanted basically self-determination in an Arab majority state so what I'm saying is the British a at some point did support the Zionist Enterprise but that other points were less consistent in the support and in 1939 until 1948 when they didn't vote even for partition for Jewish statehood in Palestine in the UN resolution they didn't support Zion during the last decade of the Mandate it's worth remembering that I I'd like to respond to that I mean speaking of propaganda um I find it simply impossible to accept um that balfor who as British prime minister in 1905 was a chief sponsor of the aliens act which was specifically he changed his mind which was specifically designed keep persecuted Eastern European Jews out of the streets of of the UK and who was denounced as an anti-semite by the entire British Jewish establishment a decade later all of a sudden changed his mind this people Chang their minds but when the when when when the changing of the mind just coincidentally happens to coincide um with the British Imperial interest I think perhaps the transformation is is is a little more superficial than he's being given credit for it it was clearly a British Imperial Venture and if there had been no threat to the Su Canal during World War I regardless of what balur would have thought about the Jews and their contribution to um history and their and their persecution and so on there would have been no B for declaration ask real quick as a question on that why did the British ever cap immigration then from Jews to that area at all well we're talking now about sure but I'm saying that if it was if the whole goal was just to be an imperialist project like there were terrorist attacks from Jewish uh yes but you're you're I'll answer you0 yeah and we're talking now about 1917 and and as I mentioned earlier I don't think the British had a Jewish state in mind that's why they used the term Jewish National home I think what they wanted was a British protectorate loyal to and dependent upon uh the British I think an outstanding um review of British policy towards these issues during the Mandate has been done by Martin Bunton of the University of Victoria and and he basically makes the argument um that once the British realized the mess they were in certainly by the late 20s early 30s they they recognized these the mess they were in the IR ilable differences and basically pursued a policy of just muddling on um and and um and muddling on in the context of British rule in Palestine um whose overall purpose was to serve um for the development of of Zionist institutions yeshua's economy and so on meant even if the British uh were not self-consciously doing this um preparing the ground work for the eventual establishment of a Jewish State I don't know if that answers your question except they did turn anti Zionist in 1939 yes of course Main and maintain that Zionist no no before they were being shot off but maintain that anti-zionist posture until 1948 okay and and if I may just also one point um you mention ha hus during were entirely legitimate um but what I but what I would also point point out is that you had a Zionist organization um the Ley 300 people more 300 people one of whom happened to become an Israeli Prime Minister and Israeli foreign minister speaker of Israeli Parliament um maybe you should give his name Yak Shamir uh proposing an alliance with Nazi Germany in 1941 Shamir propos well no the Ley proposed some people in the Lei proposed of which hamir was a prominent ring no no okay well if he's a red uh was an unimportant organization in the yesu 300 people versus 30,000 belong to the hag so it was not a very important organization it's true before the Holocaust actually began they wanted allies against the British where they could find Talking 1941 1944 41 from what I recall 1940 they were they approached the the German Emissary in or some and and and if I may proposed an alliance with Nazi Germany on what the Le he described as on the basis of shared ideolog shared ideological princip sh ideolog well they said they did they they they reved why are you doing these things of course state but you know you know what the statement said on the basis of a shared ideology why do you say no do you think that the wait the people were Nazis is that what you're saying I said no are you saying that forget statements you like to quote things but were they were they Naz were the were the Lei Nazis that's what I'm asking what did he some did he say that the basis of the PCT was their agreement on ideology there wasn't any pack they suggested they proposed an agreement right and what did the agreement say they wanted arms against the British that's what they wanted well that's what wanted also that's what people didn't work in in helping the Nazi regime I me what the IRA wanted also no but this is what husseini did you know that he was an anti-site you've probably read some of his Works he wasn't just anti-british he was also anti-semitic and he had a common ground with Hitler simp I think we can agree not every anti-semite is a hitlerite I think we that part he literally worked with the Nazis to recruit people he wasn't just a guy he was an absolutely revolting disgusting human being but the problem is you're saying was influent you're saying the I I don't even understand of all the crimes you want to ascribe to the Palestinian people trying to blame them directly indirectly indirectly or indirectly three times a moved for the Nazi Holocaust is completely lunatic on the wait there's not a he's not blaming them for the Holocaust he's saying that from the perspective wait no he's saying that from the perspective of Jews in the region Palestinians would have been part of the region that is exactly he I've him understand him here believe me I'm a lot more literate than you Mr Bell I'm going believe the guy that wrote you read the Wikipedia say I read Hebrew and you call yourself an Israeli historian all on different grounds okay if I can just respond no no I'm just saying that the there were two there were two tricks there were that's fine there were two tricks that are being played here that I think is interesting one is you guys claim that the Ley was trying to forge an alliance with Nazi Germany because of a shared ideology that's what they said yeah but hold on no no no no wait wait no no it's about what you said you brought that up to imply that Zionism must be inexorably linked I'm sorry no you're putting words in my mouth okay wait well then what was the purpose of of saying that the Lei claimed that they the Lei who were small group of people that were reviled by many in Israel not many by everybody practically they were called terrorist theist movement called them terrorists and hunted them and called himself a terrorist they were so irrelevant that their leader ended up being kicked upstairs to the leader of theel Parliament that's Israeli years to Israeli foreign minister and bean was also yes you want you want to characterize him as irrelevant as well go ahead no characteriz him as irrelevant or irrelevant based on what happens decades later the timeline matters well the question is what is the point of saying that the Le he tried to forge an relevant it's bringing up the muy of Jerusalem and trying to blame the Holocaust indect hoca the MU was the leader of the Palestine Arab national movement was 300 and he had as much to do with the Nazi Holocaust as I did no he recruited people for the SS how can you get away from that no he recruited he recruited soldiers in the balans mostly kavars which was disgusting I have no doubt about that but he had one wrote foreign minister don't let the Jews out I for minali forign Minister received letters fromus during during the Holocaust during the Holocaust don't let the Jews out don't let the Jews out I'm not saying he was a major architect minor but if we're agreed if we're agreed that Haj am Al husseini the Muti of Jerusalem collaborated with the Nazis during World War II and actively sought their sponsorship why is it irrelevant and probably wanted the destruction of European jury he probably wanted a lot of things okay okay if that's relevant why is it irrelevant that a prime minister of Israel not prime minister in 1940 41 he wasn't prime minister of Israel he was a leader of a very small terrorist group denounced as terrorist by the main of Zion do you consider it irrelevant that many years ago Mahmud Abbas wrote a doctoral thesis which is basically about mmas but I don't didn't bring it up you're the one who's bringing it up beling the Holocaust that's what you're saying the president president of the Palestinian National Authority belittle the Holocaust said it didn't happen or only a few Jews died that's a fair characterization of but I didn't bring it up I brought it up yeah okay because my question is then why is shamir's antecedence irrelevant he he was a terrorist leader of a very small marginal group was the head of the movement at the time also the the point of bring the point of bring up husseini stuff wasn't to say that he was a great further of the Holocaust it's that he might have been a great further in the prevention of Jews fleeing to go to Palestine to escape the Holocaust that that was the plan that and I explained why I think um that's that's not an entirely um accurate characterization but and then I wanted to make another point if it's legitimate to bring up his during World War II why is it illegitimate to bring up a man who would become Israel's speaker of parliament foreign minister 4 years why is it and and also he was young terrorist and was also responsible for the murder of of the United nations's First International Envoy bernotti foli bernotti why is all that irrelevant I any understand I think that the reason why he was brought up was because Jewish people at the in this time period would have viewed it as um there's a prevention of Jews leaving Europe because of the Palestinians pressuring the British to put a curb that 75,000 immigration limit yes but it's not about like it's not about them furthering the Holocaust or being an architect major minor play in the Holocaust was a major player in that region so Morris was spe made the specific claim that the Palestinians played an indirect role in the Holocaust the indirect role would have been the prevention of people escaping from yes Europe to response to that is um uh first of all I I disagree with that characterization but second of all how can you disagree with that they prevented they forced the British to prevent immigration of Jews from Europe and reaching safe Shores in Palestine that's what they did and they knew that the Jew were being persecuted in Europe was Palestine the only spot of land on Earth yes basically that was the problem the Jews couldn't immigrate about what about your great friends in Britain The Architects of of the Bal for DEC the late 1930 wer happy to take in Jews and the Americans weren't happy to take Jews why and why are Palestinians who were not Europeans who had zero role in the rise of Nazism who had no relation to any of this why are they somehow uniquely responsible for what happened in Europe to close the only safe haven for Jews that's oh really the United States wasn't a say a potential St Safe Haven the only one was Palestine at the the United States had no r room to Pacific for Jews it did have room but it didn't want that wasn't the only Safe Haven this should you be focusing your America should be blamed for not letting Jews in during the 30s are blam but nobody blames them for the Holocaust well indirect indirectly I've never heard it said that Franklin delanor Roosevelt was indirectly responsible for the Holocaust I never heard that now maybe it's in Israeli literature because the Israelis have gone mad you're yes your prime minister said the whole idea of the gas Chambers came from the Muti of Jerusalem that's nonsense we all know non but we also know that nety nany say Netanyahu says so many things which are AB happens to be the long serving prime minister of isra respons you're not responsible for them but it is relevant that he is a longest serving prime minister of Israel unfortunately it says something about the Israeli public I and he gets and he gets elected not despite such things but because he say his voters don't care aboutus or Hitler they know nothing about his voters right his Bas know nothing about know nothing about anything and he can say what he likes and they'll say yes so they don't care if he says these things you may well be right but but but anyway not to beat a dead horse but I don't I I still don't understand dead horse right I I'll just conclude by saying I don't understand why the Muti of Jerusalem is relevant he is relevant he is relevant but the head Palestinian Shamir wasn't the head of the national movement he represented 100 or 200 or 300 gunmen who are considered terrorists by the Zionist movement at the time the fact that 30 years later he becomes prime minister that's the cirks of of history and hisus he was the head of the Palestine Arab national movement at the time anyway what can you do I think we're speaking past each other not I'm talking facts let's move to the modern day and we'll return to History Maybe 67 and other important moments but let's look to today in the recent months uh October 7th let me ask sort of a pointed question was October 7th attacks by Hamas on Israel genocidal was it wasn't an act of ethnic cleansing just so we lay out the moral calculus that we are engaged in I don't maybe was the the problem the problem with October 7th is this the Hamas fighters who who um invaded Southern Israel um were sent ordered to murder rape and do all the nasty things that they did and they killed some 1200 Israelis that day and abducted um as we know something like 250 um civilian mostly civilians also some soldiers um took them back to Gaza dungeons in Gaza um but they were motivated not just by the words of their current leader in the Gaza Strip but by their ideology which is embedded in their Charter from 8 1988 if I remember correctly and that Charter is genocidal it says that the Jews must be eradicated basically from a the land of Israel from Palestine the Jews are described there as sons of apes and pigs H the Jews are a base people killers of prophets and they should not exist in Palestine it doesn't say that they NE neily should be murdered all around the world the Hamas Charter but certainly the Jews should be eliminated from Palestine and this is the driving ideology um behind the massacre of the Jews on October 7th which brought down on the Gaza Strip and I think with the intention by the Kamas of the Israeli counter offensive because they knew that that counter offensive would result in many Palestinian dead because the the Hamas Fighters and their weaponry and so on were embedded in the population in Gaza and they hoped to benefit from this in the eyes of world public opinion as Israel chased these Hamas people and their ammunition dumps and so on and killed lots of Palestinian civilians in the process all of this was understood by sinir by the head of the Kamas and he strived for that but initially he wanted to kill as many Jews as he could a A in the Border areas around the Gaza Strip I'll respond directly to the points you made and then um I'll leave it to Norm to bring in the historical context that um Hamas Charter is from the '90s I think 1988 1988 so it's from the 80s um I think your characterization of that Charter as um anti-semitic is indisputable okay I think your um characterization of that Charter is genocidal is Off the Mark it's simplicit and more importantly that Charter has been superseded by a new Charter in fact has been well there is there is a there is no new Charter there is a explanation a statement 200 something 2018 supposedly clarifying things which are in the charter but it doesn't actually step back from what the charter says eliminate Israel eliminate the Jews from the land of Israel in in 2018 the Hamas char if we look at the current version of the charter it's not a called the Char you're calling it a charter it wasn't the only thing called the charter is what was issued in 1988 by y himself anyway it makes it makes a clear distinction um between um Jews and zionists in 2018 now you can choose to dismiss it believe it it's sincere it's insincere uh whatever ins sincere is the probably the right word secondly I'm really unfamiliar um with fighters who consult the these kinds of documents uh they go ucation system in the kindergarten they're told kill the Jews they they practice with make believe guns and uniforms when they're 5 years old in the kindergartens of theas at the instruction of the commissioner general of unra right I didn't say that I said the Kamas has kindergartens and summer camps in which they train to kill Jews children five and six secondly you keep you keep saying Jews um to which I would respond the word Jews to which I would respond that Hamas does not have a record of deliberately targeting Jews who are not Israelis and in fact it also doesn't have a record of deliberately targeting either Jews or Israelis outside Israel and Palestine so you know all this talk of um unlike theah which has t Ted Jews outside we're talking we're talking about October 7th in Hamas if you'd also like to speak about hasb let's let's get to that separately if you if you don't mind um so again um genocidal well if if that term is going to be discussed my first response would be let's talk about potentially genocidal actions against Israelis rather than against Jews for the reasons that I just mentioned and again I find this constant conflation of of of of Jews Israel Zionism to be a bit disturbing secondly I think um there are uh quite a few indications in the factual record that raise serious questions about um the accusations of the genocidal intent and and genocidal practice of what happened on October 7th and my final point would be I don't I don't think I should take your your word for it I don't think you should take my word for it I think what we need here is a proper independent International investigation and the reason we need that of genocide during this conflict whether by uh Palestinians on October 7th or Israel thereafter and the reason that we need such an investigation is because Hamas is there won't be any hearings on what Hamas did on October 7th at the international court of justice um because the International Convention the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide Deals Only with with States and not with movements I think the international criminal court and specifically its current prosecutor Kim Khan lacks any and all credibility he's and been an absolute failure at his job he's just been sitting on his backside for years on this file and I think um uh I would point out that Hamas has called for independent investigations of all these allegations Israel has categorically rejected any International investigation of course fully supported by the United States um and I and I think what is required is to have credible investigations of these things because I don't think you're going to convince me I don't think I'm going to convince you and this is two people sitting across the table from each other no there certain things you don't even have to investigate you know how many citizens civilians died in the October 7th you know that there are LS of allegations of rape I don't know how persuaded you are of those they did find bodies without heads which is there were no there were there were some beheadings apparently the Israelis didn't even claim that in the document they submitted before the icj go read what your government submitted it never mentioned beheadings well as far as I know people who were beheaded but we could bring it up right now you also deny that there were rapes there I didn't deny I said not seen convincing evidence that confirms it I've said that from day one and I'll say it today 4 and a half months later do you know that they killed eight or 900 civilians in their absolutely that seems to me indisputable oh okay well I'm glad that you're I've said that from day one well to be clear you haven't you did a debate um I don't remember the talk show but you seem to imply that there was a lot of Crossfire and that it might have been the IDF I said I said that there is no question because the names were published in har there's no question that roughly of the 12200 people killed 800 of them were civilians I see 850 fine so I never said that but then I said no we don't know exactly how they were killed but 800 civilians killed no 850 no question there and I also said on repeated occasions there cannot be any doubt in my opinion as of now with the available evidence that Hamas was responsible for significant atrocities and I made sure to include the plural there's a lot of tricky language being employed here do you think of the tricky it's called attaching value to words and not talking like a motor mouth I am very careful about qualifying because that's what language is about that's great then let me just ask a clarifying question do you firmly believe that the majority of the 850 civilians were killed by Hamas my view is even if it were half 400 is a huge number by any Reckoning it's okay wait you didn't I even because Ben question because Professor moris I don't know I agree with mu raban I'm not sure if he concedes the 400 I'll say why 400 who thought up the 40000 of the 850 slaughtered byas maybe a couple of individuals were killed in this I don't I don't know you're saying you believe this particular thing you clearly don't you clearly don't believe this thing one I you said people died that's not controversial wait hold on hold on that's not controversial Mr banel Mr banel I attach value to words yes you said that you value them so much Mr Bell please slow down the speech and attempt to listen when I was explicitly asked by Pierce Mor I said there can be no question that Hamas committed atrocities on October s if you want me to pin down a number I can't do that I'm ask you to pin down a number you can listen to what I'm saying no my question is I'll ask I'll ask a very precise you because not it's a very it's a very easy question I understood your question correctly my question is do you think the majority of the people that were killed on October 7 civilians were killed by Hamas or are we subscribing to the idea that the IDF killed hundreds 500 let me explain why that's a difficult question to answer the total number of civilians killed was 8850 MH we know that Hamas is responsible um probably for the majority of those killings we also know that there were killings by Islamic Jihad we also know we we bunching together the Islamic Jihad and theas that's splitting but he means he means the Raiders he means the Raiders I'm speaking in opposition to the conspiracy theory that um people like do you prefer Norm or Professor Franklin or what do you I don't know what you're how do you PR it's not a conspiracy the the conspiracy theory is the idea that the IDF killed the majority of them it's not a conspiracy the there's there's also a theory that um as Norm pointed out on the show that he was on that he thought that it was very strange that given how reputable uh Israeli services are when it comes to sending ambulances retrieving bodies he thought it was very strange that that number was continually being adjusted do you know why say that in combination with well I'm not sure how many were killed you know why the number do you know why the number went down the number went down because the Israeli authorities were in were in possession of 200 corpses that were burned to a crisp that they assumed were Israeli um PE Israelis who had been killed on October 7th they later determined that these were in fact Palestinian Fighters now how does a Palestinian fighter get burnt to a crib no you're mixing two things some of the bodies they didn't weren't able to identify and eventually they ruled that some of them were actually Arab Marauders rather than Israeli victims some a few of them also of the Jews were burnt to a crisp and it took them time to work this out and they came out initially with a slightly higher figure 1400 dead and eventually reduced it to 1200 and Reon Isis and the reason is that a proportion of Israeli civilians killed on October 7th I don't believe it was a majority we don't know how many um some were killed in crossfire some were killed by um uh Israeli shell fire helicopter fire and so on and um uh the majority were killed by Palestinians and of that majority um we don't know I mean again I I understood your question is referring specifically to Hamas which is why I tried to answer it that way but if you meant generically Palestinians yes if you mean specifically Hamas we don't have a clear breakdown of how I don't mean specifically Hamas but I just think when you use the word some that's doing a lot of heavy li who use some that's fine but some can mean anywhere from 1% to 49% but we don't know so the numbers here and the details are uh interesting and important almost from a legal perspective but if we zoom out the moral perspective are Palestinians from Gaza justified in violent resistance well Palestinians have the right to resistance Palestinian that right includes the right to Armed resistance at the same time armed resistance um is subject to the laws of war and there are very clear regulations um that separate legitimate acts of armed resistance from acts of armed resistance um that are not legitimate and the attacks of October 7th where did they land for you there's been um almost exclusive focus on the attacks on civilian population centers and and the killings of um civilians on October 7th um what is much much less discussed to the point of um Amnesia is that there were very extensive attacks on Israeli military and intelligence facilities on October 7th I would make a very clear distinction between those two and um secondly um I'm not sure that I would characterize the efforts by um Palestinians on October 7th to seize Israeli territory and Israeli population centers as in and of themselves illegitimate you mean attacking Israeli civilians is legitimate no no that's not what I I didn't understand what you said I think what you had on October 7th was an effort by Hamas to seize Israeli territory and population and kill civilians that's not what I said what I said is I think I I'm I'm I would not describe the effort to seize Israeli territory as in and of itself illegitimate as a separate issue from the killing of Israeli civilians where um in those cases where they had been deliberately targeted that's very clearly illegitimate whole families were slaughtered in kib but I'm making many of them swingers incidentally who helped Palestinians go to hospitals in Israel and so on even drove Palestinian cancer patients to hospitals I'm making a distin you don't seem to be very condemnatory of what the Hamas did well I I don't do selective condemnation I'm not talking about selective specific condemnation of this specific on I would I would for example condemn Israeli assaults on civilians deliberate assaults on civilians I would condemn them you're not doing that theas you you know what the issue is um I've been speaking in public now I would say since the late 1980s and interviewed and so on I have never on one occasion ever been asked to condemn any Israeli act when I've been in group discussions those supporting the Israeli action or perspective I have never encountered an example where these individuals are asked to condemn what Israel is doing the um the the demand and obligation of condemnation is exclusively applied in my personal experience over decades is exclusively applied to Palestinians Israel is condemned day and night on every television channel on every and has been for the last tell you about a personal experience lasting decades you said quote Oh No I'm trying to quote what you just said I shouldn't have said anything at any you should say Professor Morris yes you just said I would condemn any time Israel deliberately attacks civilians okay the problem Professor Mars is over and over again you claim in the face of overwhelming evidence that they didn't attack civilians that's not true I've said has attacked is extensively in they K and let's let's so you're just eliminating selecting as as Ste say you cherry pick were cherry pick Let's fast forward when you were an adult what did you say about the 1982 Lebanon war what did I say you don't remember okay allow me uh oh okay so it happens that I was not at all by any I had no interest in the Israel Palestine conflict as young men until the 19 true until the 1982 Lebanon war yeah uh lost the passage I'll find it okay real quick while he's searching for that you bring up something that's really important that a lot of people don't draw distinction between in that there is just causes for war and there is just ways to act within a war and these two things principally do have a distinction from one another correct however um while I appreciate the recognition of the distinction the idea that the the cause for war that Hamas was engaged in I don't believe if we look at their actions in war or the statements they've made it doesn't seem like it had to do with territorial acquisition no no no no I the the point no the point I was making was um what was Hamas trying to achieve militarily on October 7th and I was pointing out that the focus has been very much much on um Hamas attacks on civilians and atrocities and so on and I'm not saying those things should be ignored what I'm saying is that what's getting lost in the shuffle is that there were extensive attacks on Military and intelligence facilities and as far as the let's say the other aspects are concerned um because I think either you or Lex asked me about the legitimacy of these attacks I said I'm I'm unclear whether efforts by Hamas to seize Israeli population centers in and of themselves are illegitimate as opposed to actions that either deliberately targeted Israeli civilians um or actions that um should reasonably have been expected to result in the killings of Israeli civilians those strike me as by definition illegit legitimate um and I want to be very clear about that I have where illegitimate means you condemn them illegitimate means they are not legitimate I I have a problem condemning your side yes no not condemning my side I have a problem with Selective outrage and I have a problem with Selective condemnation and as I I explained to you a few minutes ago in in my Decades of of appearing in public and being interviewed I have never seen um uh I have never been asked to condemn an Israeli action I've never been asked for a moral judgment on an Israeli action I'm um exclusive request for condemnation has to do with what Palestinians do more and just as importantly um I'm sure if you watch BBC or CNN when is the last time an Israeli spokesperson has been asked to condemn an Israeli act i' I've never seen it I don't think we condemn the Arab side either though right I don't think there was any condemnation no but now that we're talking about Israeli victims all of a sudden morality is I think the reason why it comes up is because there's no shortage of international condemnation for Israel as Norm will point out a million times that there are 50 billion un resolutions you've got Amnesty International you've got multiple bodies of the UN you've got now this case for the icj so there's no question of if there's condemnation sorry if I can interrupt you in 1948 the entire world stood behind the establishment of a Jewish state in the entire world except the Arab states and the Muslim states well not the entire world okay but I think you know what I mean by that the Western de democracies that's what you're say w democracies supported the establishment of Israel my quick question was you said that you believe that this is a very short one you don't have to it's just you think that um you think that there's an argument to be made that the people in Gaza that Hamas and Islamic J whoever participated had a just cause for war maybe they didn't do it in the correct way but they maybe had a just cause for War I don't think there's a maybe there the palestin think they absolutely had a just cause for do you think that Israel has a just cause for operation swords of iron no of course not okay all right you can say your quote okay uh first of all on this issue of double standards which is the one that uh irks or irritates M you said that you are not a person of double standards unlike people like muen you hold High A single standard and you condemn the liberate Israeli attacks on um civilians when they and I would say that's true for the period up till 1967 and I think it's accurate you uh your account of the first inap there it seems to me you were in Conformity with most mainstream accounts and the case of the first inada you also used surprisingly he used Arab human rights sources like alhak which I think M worked for during the first into further that's true but then something very strange happens so let's illustrate it wait there something strange which happened is the Arabs rejected peace offers that's what happen by accepting the Oslo agreement yeah if we have time I know the record very well I'd be very happy to go through it with you but let's get to those double standards so this is what you have have to say about Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 you said Israel was reluctant to harm civilians sought to avoid casualties on both sides and took care not to harm Lebanese and Palestinian civilians you then went on to acknowledge the massive use of IDF Firepower against civilians during the siege of Beirut which traumatized Israeli Society marks Mars quickly anwers the caveat the Israel quote tried to pinpoint military targets but inevitably many civilians were hit that's your description of the Lebanon war as I say that's when I first got involved in the conflict I am a voracious reader I read everything on the Lebanon war I would say there's not a single account of the Lebanon war in which the estimates are between 15 and 20,000 Palestinian Lebanese were killed overwhelmingly civilians the biggest blood leing until the current Gaza uh genocide uh biggest blood leing I would say I can't think of a single mainstream account that remotely approx approximates what you just said so leaving aside I can name the books voluminous huge volumes I'll just take one example now you will remember because I think you served in Lebanon in 82 am I correct on that yeah yeah yeah so you'll remember that Dove yaria C the war diary so with your permission allow me to s describe what he wrote during his diary so he writes the war machine of the IDF is Galloping and trampling over the coner conquered territory demonstrating a total insensivity incent insensitivity to the fate of the Arabs who are found in its path a PL run Hospital suffered a direct hit thousands of refugees are returning to the city when they arrive at their homes many of which have been destroyed or damaged you hear their cries of pain and their howls over the deaths of their loved ones the air is permeated with the smell of hes destruction and death are continue does Point you're making actually does that sound like your description of the Lebanon war forget my descriptions the point you're making are in print we let me let me just finish my sentence the point you're making M which you somehow forget is that there are Israelis who strongly criticize their own side and describe how Israelis are doing things which they regard as immoral you don't find that on the Arab side I'm talking about Mr Mars I'm not talking about I'm talking about you the historian how did you depict the Lebanon I believe I believe that the Israeli military tried to avoid committing a civilian C I think they all the all accounts by Robert Fisk and pity the nation F isti anist journalist I know has always been right so that's why that's why you can say with such confidence that you don't commit you don't condemn deliberate Israeli attacks and because there weren't any no I didn't say there weren't any you you agreed I have condemned Israeli attacks on civilians I never quarrel with facts your your description of the 1982 war is so shocking it makes my inner RVE and then your description of the second inada your description of defensive Shield when they the Arabs Bing Arab suicide bombers Arab suici bombers destroy fific Jews and masses and buses and in restaurants that's the second in Father do you remember that you can try suicide bombers in Jerusalem's buses and restaurants am completely aware of that but you but if you forgot the numbers I don't forget it was 3 to one the number they killed mostly armed Palestinian government that's what you say in your book that's but that's not what Amnesty International said that's not what human rights wife said don't remember they that's not I do that's not what don't whether their figures are right my figures are right listen listen in the second some Palestinians most of them armed people and Israelis thousand Israelis were killed almost all of them Professor Mars fantasy but I'm not going to argue with here here's a simple challenge you said not to look at the camera scares the people I'll make the open challenge you are going to scare them no Professor Mars open challenge words are in print I wrote 50 pages analyzing all of your work I quote some will say cherry pick but I think accurately uh quote you here's a simple challenge answer me in print answer what I wrote and show where I'm making things up answer me I'm not familiar I'm sorry I'm not familiar that's no problem you're a busy man you're an important historian you don't have to know everything that's in print especially by Publishers but now you know and so here's the public challenge you answer and show where I cherry-picked where I misrepresented send me the and and then we can have a civil scholarly discussion I'm not sure we will agree even if I we don't have to agree it's for the reader to decide looking at both sides where does truth stands no and if I may ask uh it's good to discuss ideas that are in the era now as opposed to citing literature that was written in the past as much as possible because listeners were not familiar with the literature so like whatever was written just express it uh condense the the key idea and then we can debate the ideas of this no there are two aspects there's a public debate but there's also written words yes I'm just telling you that you as a as a academic historian put a lot of value in the written word and I think it is valuable but in this inally not the only historian who puts value to words I also do actually so more than just one or two sentences at a time but this this in this context just for the educational purpose of teaching ucational purpose is why would people commit what I have to acknowledge because I am faithful to the facts massive atrocities on October 7th why did that happen and I think that's the problem the past is erased and we suddenly went from 1948 to October 7th 2023 and there is a problem there so first of all you have complete freedom to backtrack and we'll go there with you uh obviously we can't cover every single year every single event but there's probably critical moments in time can I respond to something relating to that the libanon War I looked at the book that he got this from with the quote was from um it sounds cold to say it but war is tragic and civilians die there is no war that this has not happened in in the history of all of humankind the statement that Israel might take care not to Target civilians is not incompatible with a diary entry from someone who said they saw civilians getting killed I think that sometimes we do a lot of weird games when we talk about International humanitarian law or laws that govern conflict where we say things like civilians dying is a war crime or civilian homes or hospitals getting destroyed as necessarily a war crime or is necessarily somebody intentionally targeting civilians without making distinctions between military targets or civilian ones I think that when we analyze different attacks or when we talk about the conduct of a military I think it's important to understand uh like perspectively from the unit uh of analysis of the actual military committing the acts what's happening and what are the decisions being made rather than just saying retrospectively oh well a lot of civilians died not very many you know military people died comparatively speaking so uh it must have been war crimes especially when you've got another side um fast forward to Hamas that intentionally attempts to induce those same civilian numbers because Hamas is guilty of any War crime that you would potentially accuse and this is according to the Amnesty International people that Norm loves to site Hamas is guilty of all of these same war crimes of them failing to take care of the civilian population of them essentially utilizing human Shields to try to fire Rockets free from Attack essentially yes as I'm just saying that essentially yes in terms of how international law defines and not how Amnesty International defin but amesty International describes times of human shielding but they don't actually apply the correct International legal standard know what's the correct absolutely I absolutely abely I'm just saying I'm just saying leave it or not normal the entire Geneva conventions is all on Wikipedia it's a wonderful website but I'm just saying I'm just saying that on the Hamas side if there's an attempt to induce this type of military activity attempt to induce civilian harm that it's not just enough to say like well here's a diary entry where a guy talks about how tragic I think the problem I think the problem with with with your statement is that if you go back and listen to it the first part of it is War as hell civilians die it's it's a fact of life and and and you state that in a very factual matter then when you start talking about Hamas all of a sudden you've discovered morality and you've discovered condemnation and you've discovered intent and and and you are unfortunately far from alone in this I'll give you I'll give you you know who for me is a perfect example wait hold on just resp we don't need examples the false equivalency of the two sides is astounding when Hamas kills civilians in a surprise attack on October 7th this isn't because they are attempting to Target military targets and they happen to stumble into a giant Festival of people that well they did happen to stumble into it they did but k00 but they but when they stumbled into it it wasn't an issue of trying to figure out a military Target or not they weren't failing a distinction there wasn't a proportionality assessment done it was just to kill civilians even the Amnesty International in 2008 and in 2014 and even today we'll say'll find anyone who will deny that Hamas has targeted civilians you gave the example there's a difference of suicide bombings uh during the second interal I mean facts are facts sure but I'm saying that the Hamas targeting of in civilians is different than the incidental loss of life that occurs when Israel does you know genocide is the intentional mass murder genocide is a entirely separate claim yeah but the idea that Israel is not in the business of intentionally targeting civilians um I know that's what we're supposed to believe um but but the historical record stands very clearly I it does you've written about when you say historical do you mean like in the 40s to the 60s or do you mean like over the from the 30s of the last century to the 20s of this Century I I just like to make you know you the way the way you um characterized it I think the best example of that of come across during this specific conflict is is John Kirby the White House spokesman I've I've named HIM Tears tosterone for a very good reason um when he's talking about Palestinian civilian deaths War as hell you know it's a fact of life get used to it when he was confronted with Israeli civilian deaths on October 7th he literally broke down he understood that one is deliberate and one isn't he understood that no that's what he tried to make us understand no he he's he was speaking facts the Kamas guys who attacked the Kim they apart from the attacks on the military sites when they attacked the kibuts were out to kill civilians and they killed family after family house after house the Israeli attacks on Hamas installations and know better no you don't know Israeli Pilots That's thank God you know no you don't know pilot they believe that they are killing Hamas Niks they're giv they and if theas is hiding behind civilians they target every time they target a kid I'm sure they believe it's Hamas when they kid yeah when they yeah when they killed the four kids in the on the they believe they I know they believe even though they were dtive side even though they were angle you don't see the no they saw let's see the oh I know what he's quoting correctly you've lied about this particular instance in the past those kids weren't just on the beach as as often stated in articles those kids were literally coming out of a previously identified Hamas compound that they had operated from they literally with all due respect with all due respect you're such a fantastic it's terrifying that that Warf was filled with journalists there were tens scores of journalist that was an Old Fisherman's Shack what are you talking about it's so painful it's so painful to listen to this idiocy and C on the other side you're implying strike was okay on the Israeli side where they said we're just going to kill four Palestinian children today for no reason you believe that do you believe that do you believe that right said right journalist do you think that they children question he will never answer that question I will answer the question were out and it was because that was a strike that was a drone strike so it was a proof all the way up chain that we're going to kill children today kill pales you want me to answer or do you want your motor mouth to go okay answer in 2018 there was the great March of return in Gaza by all reckonings of Human Rights organizations and journalists who were there it was overwhelmingly nonviolent it organized by theas what whoever organized organized by Satan let's startas Satan I I agree let's let's go for the big one the big mcgilla it's Satan okay oh overwhelmingly organiz overwhelmingly nonviolent resembled at the beginning the first the first in represent the yeah yeah okay not bombs but they tried to make holes in the Spence obviously let's continue yeah so but I'm not sure Israel behaved morally in that okay no no no I wait wait wait I'm willing to Grant you please please I'm willing to allow me to you don't have to pursue allow me allow me to finish I don't know anything about this I'd like to Okay so as you know along the Gaza perimeter there was Israel's best trained snipers correct I don't know best train they were snipers fine snipers okay all right hey laugh it's hilarious the story is so funny you're lying about return had aspects of violence to it ACC even the UN says it themselves okay but you only collect what the UN says that you like see the problem Mr Morelli is you don't know the L English language you don't I can read from the UN website itself in regards to the great March of return they said while the vast majority of protesters acted in a peaceful manner during most protests dozens have approached the fence attempting to damage it burning fires throwing stones and moloto Cocktails towards Israeli forces and flying incendiary Kites and balloons into Israeli territory the latter results in extensive damage to agricultural land and nature reserves inside Israel and risk the lives of Israeli civilians some in of shooting throwing explosives also talk fast people think that you're coherent I'm just reading from the UN yeah but you see I you like them only when they age with you you got the months wrong you got the months wrong we're talking about the beginning in March 30th 2018 you just describe that March as mostly peaceful allow me to finish so there were the snipers okay now you find it so far-fetched Israelis purposely deliberately targeting civilians that's such a far-fetched idea an overwhelmingly nonviolent March what did the international inves it was a campaign whatever you want to call for months whatever you want to call months yeah what did the UN investigation find well he just read I read the report I don't read things off of those machines I read the report what did it find brace yourself you thought it was so funny the idea of IDF uh targeting civilians it found go look this up in your machine I already know what you're gonna say you're gonna say found only one or two of them were Justified targeted journalists targeted Medics and here's the funniest one of all it's so hilarious they targeted disabled people who were 300 M away from the fence and just standing by this is true if what you're say just quick pause uh I think everything was fascinating to listen to except the mention of hilarious nobody finds any of this hilarious and if any of us are laughing it's not at the suffering of civilians or suffering of anyone it's at the uh the obvious joyful camaraderie in the room so I'm I'm enjoying it and also the joy of learning so thank you can we talk about the targeting civilian thing a little bit I think there's like an important underlying not necessarily that I just I think it's important to understand yeah I think it's important to understand there's like three different things here that we need to think about so one is a policy of killing civilians do we so I would ask the other side I'm going to ask all three because I know there won't be a short answer do you think there is a policy topped down from the IDF to Target surance that's one thing a second thing is when I yeah that's okay but then then the second thing is or there's there's two distin I want to draw between I think Benny would say this I would say this um I'm sure undoubtedly there have been cases where IDF soldiers For No Good Reason have targeted and killed Palestinians that they should not have done that would be prosecutable as war crimes as defined by the r stat some have been prosecuted absolutely practically n I'm sure I'm sure I'm you and your I'm sure that we would all agree for soldiers that that happens but I think that it's important I think that it's important that when we talk about military strikes or we talk about things especially involving bombings or drone attacks these are things that are signed off by multiple different layers of command by multiple people involved in an operation including intelligence gathering including weering and also have typically lawyers involved when you make the claim that an IDE of solders shot uh a Palestinian those three people the three hostages that came up with white flags and something horrible happened I think that's a fair statement to make and I think a lot of criticism is deserved but when you make the statement that four children were killed by a strike the claim that you're making yeah the claim that you're making the claim that you're making is that multiple levels of the IDF signed off on just killing I have no idea what you don't understand the process let me educate you I can tell you I do understand the process I'm telling you I'm trying to explain you right now yes no it's basic ask anybody to about Wikipedia can you tell me your know to people who work in the military what's your knowledge of the idea audience can look this up do you think that do you think that do you think that bombing and Strikes are decided by one person in the field do you think one person a pilot doesn't do it on own entire apparates that are designed to figure out how to strike and who to strike So when you say that four children are targeted you're saying that a whole apparatus is trying to murder Palestinian children my argument than ridiculous argument because oh really that it's impossible at the command level it's impossible at that command level but you said that they couldn't have done it at the bottom if it weren't also you need you don't understand the strength of the claim that you're making you're saying that from a top down level that lawyers multiple commanders sign not tell me what I don't understand or Palestinians it's true it's true I don't spend my nights on Wikipedia I read books I admit that as a a signal as I know books are a waste of time with all due regard there are the only you take from them are two or three quotes you completely respect I completely respect the fact and I'll say it on the air as much as I find totally disgusting what's come of your politics a lot of the books are excellent and I'll even tell you because I'm not a afraid of saying it whenever I have to check on a basic fact the equivalent of going to the britanica I go to your books I know you got a lot of the facts right Benny Moore's book I would never say books are a waste of time and it's regrettable to you that you got strapped with a partner who thinks that all the wisdom all the wisdom he didn't say that a waste of time I I'd like to respond to what you were saying um the the I think the question that that we're trying to answer I think I think you don't understand Israel you know nether let me let me finish pleas understands I think we're I think we're all agreed that Palestinians have deliberately targeted civilians whether we're talking about Hamas and Islamic Jihad today or previously I prefer the word murdered and raped rather than targeted Target is too soft for what the Hamas did I'm okay I'm not I'm not talking about talking about this now yeah but I'm I'm trying to answer his question yeah yeah um historically there is um substantial evidence that Palestinians have targeted uh civilians whether whether it's been incidental or systematic is a different discussion I don't want to get into that now for some reason there seems to be a huge debate about whether any Israeli has ever sunk so low as as to Target a civilian I don't no we've agreed both said this has happened here and there and I think we've agreed on that okay I think um what we're saying is it's not policy which is what you guys are implying that they kill civilians deliberately if I understand you correctly you're basically making the claim that none of these attacks could have happened without going through an entire chain of commands strike cells that are involved in like drone attacks or plane attacks yes my understanding of the Israeli military and you could perhaps um you've served in it you would know better it's actually a fairly chaotic Organization no no that's not true especially not the Air Force extremely extremely organized the Air Force Works in a very organized fashion as he says with lawyers chain of command and ultimately the pilot drops the bomb where he's told to drop it protective Edge was that 200 200 strikes in like 60 seconds I think I think at the opening of protective Edge like the yeah the coordination between talking about 2008 uh for I think was 2014 but I'm just saying that the coordination in the military is pretty well my my understanding of the Israeli military especially is that it's quite chaotic and there's also a lot of testimonies from Israel but be that as it may okay I'm I'm prepared to accept um both of your contentions that it's a a highly organized and disciplined Force Air Force under any scenario is going to be more organized than the other branches and and you're saying such a strike would have been inconceivable I'm well I'm not necessarily saying incon that like that would have required Mur intent so many I don't think good evidence been presented to say that that's your basic claim is that we we we it would be fair to assume that such a strike could have only been carried out with multiple um uh levels of authorization and and and signing off okay let's accept that for the sake of argument um we have now seen incident after incident after incident after incident where entire families are vaporized and and single strikes who is in the families who lives in the house family MERS no next to the house these families we have seen incident do you know that kamnik weren't in that house do you know that they ammunition dumps weren why I have to prove a negative you're saying that they deliberately targeted families if Israel wanted to kill civilians in in in Gaza they could have killed 500,000 by now with the number of strikes and the fact that they only killed a certain small number, is a small number small number in 30,000 number proportion over four months probably is an indication 12000 targeted and that there are Hamas Targets in these places so I've I've get 12,000 children is only and if that's the case why is it yeah you said only only though Professor Mars here's a question for you if we take every combat zone in the world for the past three years every combat zone in the world in Vietnam the Americans killed talking about I was in yeah I was in the anti-war movement so don't k a million people inet fine fine and and uh 30 million Russians were killed so in during World War II so everything else is irrelevant okay here's a question professor professor Mars here's a question it's very perplexing if you take every combat zone in the world for the past three years and you multiply the number of children killed by four every combat zone in the world you get gossip okay so when you supposed to prove okay I'm going to I'm going to tell shut up you're relying numbers no I'm not I'm rying on the numbers that everybody else I'm rying on the numbers what that those numbers okay which may not be true they could invent any anything because you know that they are aous organ I know mendacious believe me mous as in the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs okay so here's the thing you say they could have killed 500,000 but they only killed only that's your word only killed 30,000 you believe that they deliberately Target civilians they could would have killed the fact is tar cilian Professor Maris for you don't understand for hisian I don't want to understand Israeli Society you want to know the truth I don't want to I don't want to gide their heads that's the problem 90% of a good historian good historian tries to get into the heads of's a liit theist there's a limit when 90% when 90% of Israelis think that Israel is using enough or too little force in Gaza I don't want to get inside that head 40% think that Israel is using insufficient force in Gaza I don't want to gide that head I don't want to gide the head of people who think they're using insufficient Force against the population against the population half of which is children I don't want to get inside that head but here's the point because your partner wants to know the point you don't understand political constraints one of your ministers said let's drop an atomic bomb on you think he really meant that he said it no no no it was said in a sort of a questionable way he didn't say they should I'm not supporting ID this Minister this minister is aiic idiot he didn't say dropping up none other none other than Israel's Chief historian the famed justifiably famed Benny Maris thinks we should be dropping nuclear weapons on Iran Iran has for years its leaders for years have said we should destroy Israel you agree with that they've said we should destroy Israel Israel must be destroyed have you is that correct this is what the Iranian leaders have been saying since I would say Iranian leaders have sent mixed messages okay okay but some of them have said including if you don't knowm it's very funny that supports and the H and Hamas they yourself wait wait wait to the extent the hou are to the extent that the houthis are trying to stop the genocide in go there is no have right to selectively support international law when it agrees with you and then when it doesn't you decide to throw International laaz if you like let me read what you said Norm stop please Norm just for me please just give me a second you said that there's no genocide going on in Gaza let me ask that clear question yes the same question I asked on Hamas attacks is there from a legal philosophical moral perspective is there genocide going on in Gaza today is there a genocide going on in Gaza well in several years we will have a definitive response to to that question what has happened thus far is that on the 29th of December the Republic of South Africa instituted um proceedings against Israel pursuant to the 1948 convention on the prevention and Punishment of the crime of genocide um South Africa basically accused Israel of perpetrating um genocide in the Gaza Strip on the 26th of January the um uh the court issued its initial ruling the court at this stage um is not making a determination on whether Israel has or has not um committed genocide so just as it has not found Israel guilty it certainly also hasn't found Israel innocent what the court had to do at this stage was take one of two decisions either South Africa's case was um the the equivalent of a frivolous lawsuit and dismiss it and close the proceedings or it had to determine that um South Africa presented a plausible case that Israel was violating its obligations um under the genocide convention and that it would on that basis hold um a full hearing now a lot of people have um looked at the Court's ruling of the 26th of January and focused on the fact that the court did not order a ceasefire I actually wasn't expecting it to order a ceasefire and I wasn't surprised that it didn't because in the other cases that that the court has considered most prominently um Bosnia and Myanmar it also didn't order a ceasefire um and South Africa in requesting a ceasefire also didn't ask the court to render an opinion on the legitimacy or lack thereof of Israel's um of Israel's military operation from my perspective um the key issue on the 26th of January was whether the court would simply dismiss the case or decide to proceed with it and it decided to proceed it decided to and I think that's enormously that enormously you said they committ genocide you already said they committed genocide is committing genocide allow allow me allow me that's correct now I don't run away so Norman you did say isra can you let Finish Well the end of the story is you specifically asked whether I think Israel is committing genocide I explained formally there is no finding and as you said we won't know for a number of years and I think there's legitimate questions to be raised I mean in the Bosnia case which I think all four of us would agree was clearly a case of genocide the court determined mean by the serbs yes and in the bosia case the court determined that of all the evidence placed before them only Sanita qualified as genocide and all the other atrocities committed did not qualify as genocide you know international law is a developing uh organism I don't know how the court is going to respond um in this case so I wouldn't take it as a foregone conclusion um how the court is going to respond but Norman has determined already I have too because you ask my personal op personal opinion is also so as As a matter of law I want to State very clearly has not been determined and won't be determined for several years based on my um uh observations and and the evidence before me I would say it's indisputable that Israel is engaged in a genocidal assault against the Palestinian people in the Gaza P line yeah with the program the PLO is long past what okay the authority as as as you were saying um genocide is is is not a body count um genocide consists of two elements um the destruction of a people and whole or in part so in other words you can commit genocide by killing 30,000 people it doesn't have well five probably is below the thresold number yes but I think 30,000 crosses the threshold and not reaching 500 ,000 is probably relevant and the second element is there has to be an intent in other words and you believe there's an intent yes I think if if there is any other plausible reason for why all these people are being murdered it's not genocide and as far as intent what about hiding behind a human shield you don't think that's the reason for them being killed well let's get the intent part out of the way first um South Africa's U forget South Africa they're part I'd like to finish government that's that's got nothing to do with I think they're Pro Satan as well last time no they're proas um you know for some reason you don't have a problem with people being pro-israeli at the time of of of of this but if they support Palestinians right to life or self-determination they get demonized and delegitimized as Pro they supported an organization which murdered 1200 people deliberately that's my problem but supporting a state that has murdered 30,000 but they haven't because these are 30,000 basically human Shi used by theas which theas wanted wanted killed they wanted them killed Hamas wanted these people killed if I could just get you don't think they wanted them killed they didn't provide them with shelters they build tunnels for their Fighters but not one shelter for their own civilian you asked me about int course they want them killed okay you asked me about intent and the reason that I bought in um the South African application is because it is actually exceptionally detailed on tent by quoting numerous all sorts of idiotic ministers in Israel well yeah including the Prime Minister the defense minister the chief of say genocide he said the word are a really according to ASA kaser the philosopher of the IDF yeah he said that Netanyahu was avowing genocide now he's an idiot so didn't say he's an idiot pass it so the reason I raised the South African application is twofold Hamas or no Hamas it's exceptionally detailed on the question of on the question of intent and secondly when when the international court of justice issues a ruling individual justices um have have the right can give their own opinion and I found the German one to be the most interesting on on this specific question because he was basically saying that he didn't think South Africa presented a persuasive case but he said there um their section on intent was so overpowering that he felt he was left with no choice but to vote with with the majority so I think that answers um the intent part of your question so for the icj case that South Africa's brought I think there's a couple things that need to be mentioned one is and I saw you two talk at length about this the plausibility standard is incredibly low the only thing we're looking for is a basic presentation of facts that make it conceivable possible that PL plausible which legally this is obviously below criminal conviction below um yeah below think of it as an indictment sure possibly maybe even a a lower level than even an indictment so plausibility is an incredibly low standard number one um number two uh if you actually go through and you read the complaint that South Africa filed um I would say uh that if you go through the quotes and you even follow through to the source of the quotes the misrepresentation that South Africa does and their case about all of these horrendous quotes in my opinion borders on criminal well 16 icj judges disagree with that's fine if 16 IG CJ judges disagree must be competent you know they could be but he must be all even the American judge she must have been awful incompetent if she was unable to see the misrepresentations that Mr benell based on his Wikipedia entry was able to find so this is based on the official icj report that was released I'm not sure if you read the entire thing or that's great did you go through and actually identify any of the sources for the underlying quot actually brace yourself for this and M could confirm it Yaniv kogan an Israeli and Jamie Stern reer half Israeli they checked every single quote in the Hebrew original and Yaniv kogan love the guy he has terrifying powers of concentration he checked every single quote is that correct mine and Jaimie checked every single quote in the English in the context and where there were any contextual questions they told us I think they found one yeah I think they found one so I do not believe that those 16 15 judges was 15 to2 16-2 I think they're 15 in the court plus two so it's 17 So it's 15 to two uh I don't think those 15 judges were incompetent and I certainly don't believe the president of the Court an American would allow herself to be duped okay let me let read one sure so this was uh taken from the uh from the South African complaint there's tons of these but so here's one uh in the in the complaint for the icj they said that on the 12th of October 2023 president Isaac her Herzog made clear that Israel was not distinguishing between militants and civilians in Gaza stating in a press conference to foreign media in relation to Palestinians in Gaza over 1 million of whom are children quote quote it's an entire nation out there that is responsible it is not true this rhetoric about civilians not aware not involved it's absolutely not true and we will fight until we break their backbone end quote if you actually go to the news article that they even State they even link it in their complaint the full context for the quote was quote it is an entire nation out there that is responsible it's not true this rhetoric about civilians not being aware not involved it's absolutely not true they could have risen up they could have fought against that evil regime which took over Gaza in audet but we are at War we are defending our homes we are protecting our homes that's the truth and when a nation protects its home it fights and we will fight until we break their backbone he acknowledged that many Goins had nothing to do with Hamas but was adamant that others did quote I agree there are many innocent Palestinians who don't agree with this but if you have a missile in your goddamn kitchen and you want to shoot it at me am I allowed to defend myself we have to defend ourselves we have the right to do so this is not the same as saying there's no distinction between militants and civilians in Gaza his statement here is actually fully compliant with international law to the letter because if you are storing mil uh military supplies in civilian areas these things become military targets and you're allowed to do proportionality assessments afterwards so if this is supposed to be one of many quotes that they've shown that is supposed to demonstrate uh genocidal intent but it is very easily explained by military intent or by a conflict between two parties I saw that press conference wait let me just say something all of this talk is a bit irrelevant because it sounds it may sound to the listeners that the the court in the hog has ruled that Israel is committing genocide but it hasn't has it's just is going in the next few years to look at the whole there has been no no determination at all and as as Steven says some of the quotes are not exactly accurate quotes or taken out characterization okay it this correct as muen put it that it'll be seven several years before the court makes a determination and my guess is that we'll determine there was no genocide that's my guess yes I'm just giving you my guess uh I can't predict I got it all wrong actually as Molen will attest I got it all wrong the first time I never thought the American judge would vote again would vote in favor of plausibility so you admit that you were wrong yeah of course I think I tell M twice a day I was wrong about this and I was wrong about that I'm not wrong about the facts I try not to be but my speculations they can be wrong okay leaving that aside first of all as M pointed out there's a difference between the legal decision by the ruling and an independent judgment now South Africa was not filing a frivolous case that was 84 Pages it was single even 84 Pages be prous an hour and a half to read it was not a massive Cas it was single spaced and had literally hundreds of footnotes with it's possible of course one wasn't yeah I read the report to tell you the truth I followed very closely everything that's been happening to October 7th I was mesmerized I couldn't believe the comprehensiveness of that particular report number two there are two quite respected judges excuse me there were two quite respect Ed uh Experts of international law sitting on the South African panel John Dugard and vau low v l as you might know he argued the war case in 2004 before the international court of justice now they were not uh they were alleging genocide which in their view means the evidence in their minds we not yet at the court the evidence in their minds compels the conclusion that genocide is being committed I am willing because I happen to know Mr Dugard personally and I've correspond with vau low I've heard their claim I read the report uh I would say they make a very strong case but let's agree plausible now here's a question if somebody qualifies for an Olympic team let's say a regional person qualifies for Olympic team it doesn't mean they're going to be on the Olympic team it doesn't mean they're going to win a gold medal a a silver medal or brown bronze metal they can swim that's what you're saying no I would say that's a very high bar saying they can swim to even qualify swim well enough to have a realistic Prospect so to even make it to plausible that is not true that is not what plaus means it is absolutely not you're dead wrong Mr berelli please don't teach me about the English language so the Declaration judge I saidil qualifying the court is not asked at this present phase of the proceedings to determine whether South Africa's allegations of genocide are well founded they're not well founded they're not even well founded the you said that plausible is a high standard is absolutely not it is a misrepresentation of the strength of the case against Israel just like the majority of the said itations pulled from the report that try to uh that actually deal with the intent part which is by the way I think you guys I don't know if you use the phrase the doo specialis that the intentional part of genocide the the I think it's I think it's called Doo specialis it is the most important part of genocide which is proving the special is a highly special intent to commit genocide it's possible Israel that's men's no Pro the men's yes I understand the state of mind but in for genocide there is it's called do specialis it's a highly special intent did you read the case yeah it is high special intent yes please stop displaying your imbecility okay I'm sorry if you think the Declaration of the don't put on public display that you're a at least have the self-possession to shut up did I readable putting my display on camera you're putting yours in books read case around four times I read all of the the uh the majority opinion the Declarations I read Aron barack's declaration then why are you lying and saying plaus are high standard because I said even reaching the Benchmark of plausibility is a very high standard in the world it's the equivalent of a regional player qualifying for Olympics it's still two steps removed you may not be on the team and you may not get a medal but to get qualified which in this context is the equivalent of plausible you must be doing something pretty horrible as it happens as it happens there was no that's what the court R rule remember what I just told you the court I don't expect to be even around when the court reaches his final deis why why it'll take a long long time two years three years no I don't think it'll take two or three years Bosnia which was admittedly a special type of case because they were accusing Serbia of sponsoring the Bosnian serbs that took I think 17 years from 90 I assume they'll take two or three years but the point you're making so this is a legal something horrible must be happening to even achieve it's horrible it's a war yeah it's true they weren't they weren't rendering a ruling on a war they were rendering a ruling on a genocide and I think I think the suggest they said it was plausible they also said it was plausible that Israel is committing a military operation as well yeah but I think the problem with with your characterization is you're saying in so many words the South Africans basically only have to show up in court with a coherent statement that is correct in today's atmosphere that's probably correct they needed to do a lot more they they needed they needed americ Jud atmosphere americ judge to judges go according to what the majority want want to hear president they needed to persuade the court that it was worth investing several years of their time in hearing they're well paid whether they take this case or not I mean you know they have a they have a full docket um whether they accept or reject this case and I I think I don't think we should remember what I just said they won't rule there was genocide remember what I said also I recommend people actually the case and follow through a lot of the quotes that they just don't show genocidal the Israeli Minister of Finance on the 8th of October 2023 this is taken from the icj this is from South Africa submission uh bizal smotri I can't read this stated there you go okay at a meeting of the Israeli cabinet that quote we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza end quote but again if you click through and you read The Source their own linked Source it says as per this own source quote the powerful Finance Minister settler leader Bez Tri I can't pronounce this demanded at the cabinet meeting late Saturday that the Army quote hit Hamas brutally and not take the matter of the captives into significant consideration end quot in war as in war you have to be brutal end quot he was quoted as saying we need to deal a blow that hasn't been seen in 50 years and take down Gaza end quote you can't strip the quotation of Hamas a entity have war with and then Pretend There's genocidal intent genocide so when the ukrainians when the ukrainians say we need to Russia that's not genocide when Ukraine says we need to defeat Russia is that genocidal mean killing all Russian C Professor Mars here's another one when the defense yeah ridiculous yes ridiculous uh the American judge he also doesn't determine policy the American judge the American judge read you are holding the American judge to you know well he was the president he'll Authority when it agrees with him and we won't deal with the actual facts of the matter ever okay the American judge read several of the quotes look at the American supreme court today they may support Trump shows you how Jud Professor Mars without going too far a field if you heard a statement by the defense minister the defense minister said we are going to prevent any food water fuel or electricity from entering Gaza do that he did Israel do that okay no I'm I'm I'm wondering what he said I'm asking you isn't Israeli government poliy talking about statements Now intent how would you interpret that after 1,00 of your citizens are murdered the way they were I would expect extreme statements by lots of politicians but but you're by lots of politici but you don't accept extreme polic but you don't accept he said is an Israeli policy they let in water they let in gas you don't accept but you don't accept extreme Palestinian statements after they lost their entire country not just 12200 people that's a good point no no it's a good point and on that uh on on that moment brief moment of agreement let's just take a quick pause we need a smoke break need a water break bath break take down Gaza is not a genoci defeat Russia is a genocidal stat we went to war with Iraq and we wanted to destroy Iraq that was a genocidal statement there's a reason why genocide is so is such an importantly guarded concept and it's not to to condemn every nation that goes to war wait you do know how to pronounce my name are you mispronouncing it he made you into an Italian all the time by your solicitude for international law you should try learning it sometime it would help you sort out a lot of the civilian deaths unfortunately 15 judges disagree you could keep citing the judges you should actually try reading the actual statements this is tiring how you you've invited us to a tiring session yeah there you go how you guys doing okay okay there there are major things to discuss here not just what what some court is doing and going to judge in two years time yes okay so what you just said is my whole one of the reasons why I feel so strongly about this particular conflict is because there are really important things to discuss but they will never be discussed they're not we're not going to talk about like uh like uh area A and C or what a transference of ter instead we're going to talk about aparti we're not going to talk about um you know the differences in how do you conduct war in an urban environment where people we're just going to talk about genocide we're not going to talk about what's a good solution for the palan we're just going to say ethnic possible to talk be productive over the next two hours and talk about Solutions about Solutions I have no idea what to say I mean there there I don't see any solutions on you know if you wanted a positive end to this discussion which is what you said at the beginning I can't contribute to that because I I'm pessimistic I don't see anywhere any way forward here but the lack of the solution is is easy the reason why the solution is hard is because the histories in the myths are completely there's a different factual record one of the things it' be good to talk about Solutions with the future is going back in all the times that has failed so every time but even at that we're probably not going to agree he's going to say you can write that I can predict the whole line he's going to say from 93 to 99 he's going to say Israel didn't adhere to the oso courts ever settlement expansion continued uh raids happened into the uh West Bank that there was never a legitimate that Netanyahu came in and violated the um the Y memorandum the transference he's goingon to say all of this and he's not going to bring up anything pales side and then for Camp David he's going to say that uh yeah that Arafat was trying that the maps in the territorial exchange wasn't good enough that they were asking Palestinians to make all the concessions that Israel would have like it's yeah well well lay it all up Lay It Up you do talk quickly you know yeah I know yeah any my future book should interest you guys oh what are you working on it no it's not working on it's actually going to come out ah um it deals with Israeli and Arab atrocities war crimes I call them in the 48 War that's book yeah just deals with that subject is this um cuz I know you've also uh talked about the closure of the archives and stuff well it's it's marginal they do it deals with that as well but they have tried to seal off documents which has already used and seen now they don't let people see them that's happened but it's it's it's marginal in terms of its effect on on on were the British archives useful for you for this new book well for this list it's mostly Israeli archives the British and the Americans and the UN did deal with these subjects but not not as well as Israeli documents what's your uh casual count for dar it's about 100 I think there's agreement on that by Israelis and Arabs 100 105 cuz before they were they used to say 245 or 254 those were the figures the British and the Arabs and the hag agreed on at at the beginning because the Red Cross I think was the one that first put out that number I don't remember maybe it was what's his name Jac de reer maybe yeah maybe he he came up with that number but it was just he didn't count they didn't count bodies they just threw the number out and everybody was happy to blame the and the for you know killing more Arabs than actually well and and they put it to good use as well well they said that it helped to precipitate more evacuation so they were and as they also use that number yeah so first of all thank you for that heated discussion about the present I would love to go back into history in a way that informs what we can look for in a uh as a by way of Hope for the future so when has in Israel and Palestine have we been closest to something like a peace settlement to something that like where both sides would be happy and enable the flourishing of both peoples well my my from my knowledge of the 120 years or so of conflict the closest I think the two sides have been to reach in some sort of settlement appears to have been in the year 2000 when Barack and then subsequently Clinton ER offered a two-state um settlement ER to PLO Palestinian Authority chairman yaser Arafat and Arafat seemed to waver he didn't immediately in reject what was being offered But ultimately came down at the end of Camp David in July 2000 he came came down against the proposals and the Clinton who said he wouldn't blame him later blamed Arafat for bringing down the summit and um not reaching a solution there um but I I think there on the table H certainly in the Clinton parameters of December 2000 which followed ER the proposals by Barack in July um the Palestinians were offered the best deal they're ever going to get from Israel unless Israel is destroyed and then they'll just be a Palestinian Arab state but um the best deal that Israel could ever offer them they were offered which essentially was 95% of the West Bank East Jerusalem half of the old city of Jerusalem some sort of joint control of the Temple Mount and the Gaza Strip of course in full and the Palestinians said no to this deal and nobody really knows why Arafat said no that is some people think he was trying to hold out for slightly better term um but my my reading is that he was constitutionally psychologically incapable of signing off in a two-state deal meaning acceptance of the existence of a Jewish State this was really the problem and of Israel or of a Jewish state of a Jewish State the Jewish state of Israel he wasn't willing to share Palestine with the Jews and put his name to that I I think he just couldn't do it that's my reading but some people say it was because the terms were insufficient and he was willing but was waiting for slightly better terms I don't I don't I don't buy that I don't think so but other people disagree with me on this what what do you think well just briefly in response um Arafat formerly recognized Israel in in 1993 yeah earlier um I don't I don't think actually that in 201201 uh a genuine um resolution was on offer because I think the maximum Israel was prepared to offer admittedly more than it had been prepared to offer in the past fell short of the minimum that the Palestinians consider to be reasonable two-state settlement bearing in mind um that as of 1949 uh Israel controlled 78% of the British Mandate of Palestine um the Palestinians were seeking a state on the remaining 22% and this was apparently too much for Israel my my response to your question would be wait wait they were being offered something like 22 or 21% they were being offered I think um less than a withdrawal to the 1967 borders with mutual and minor and reciprocal land swaps and the just resolution of uh the refugee problem was one of the question yes um you know I I worked for a number of years um with um uh International CR crisis group and my boss at the time was Rob Mali who was one of the American officials pres thrown out of the state department whatever the point I'm the point I want to make about um uh Rob was he wrote I think a very perceptive article in 2001 in the New York Review books I know that you and ahud Barack have had a debate with them but I think he gives a very compelling reason of why and how um uh Camp uh Camp David failed but rather than going into that I'll he wrote that together with Hussein ARA husin ARA yes who was not at Camp David um but in response to your question um I think there could have been a real possibility of Israeli Palestinian and Arab Israeli peace in the mid1 1970s in the wake of the 1973 October War um uh I'll I'll recall that in 1971 mosid Dean Israel's uh defense minister at the time uh full of triumphalism about Israel's uh victory in 1967 speaking to a group of Israeli military veterans stated you know if I had to choose between um sh without peace or peace without sh this is referring to the um Resort and an an Egyptian s which was then under Israeli occupation Dean said I will choose for sh without peace um then the 1973 war came along and um uh I think Israeli calculations began to change very significantly and I think it was in that context that had there been a joint us Soviet um push for um uh an Arab Israeli and Israeli Palestinian resolution that incorporated both an Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 lines and the establishment of a Palestinian State um in in the occupied territories I think it there was a very reasonable Prospect for that being achieved it ended up being aborted I think um uh for several reasons and ultimately um the Egyptian uh president Anar Sadat um decided uh for reasons we can discuss later to launch a separate unilateral Initiative for um Israeli Egyptian rather than Arab Israeli peace and I think once that set in motion um the prospects uh disappeared because Israel essentially saw its most powerful adversary removed from the equation and felt that this would give it a free hand in the occupied territories also in Lebanon to get rid of the PLO and so on so um you know and you ask when were we closest and I can't give you an answer of when we were closest I can only tell you when I think we we could have been uh close and that was a that was a lost opportunity um if we look at the situation today you know there's been a lot of discussion about a two-state settlement my own View and I've I've written about this uh I don't I don't bu the arguments of the naysayers that we have passed uh the so-called point of no return with respect to a two-state settlement certainly if you look at the Israeli position in the occupied territories I would argue it's more tenuous than was the French position in Algeria in 1954 then was a British position in Ireland in 1916 then was the Ethiopian position in uh itria in 1990 and so as a matter of practicality as a matter of principle I do think um the establishment of a Palestinian State uh in in the occupied territories remains realistic I think the question that we now need to ask ourselves it's one I'm certainly asking myself um since October 7th and looking at Israel's genocidal campaign but also looking at larger questions is it desirable can you have peace with what increasingly appears to be an irrational genocidal state that seeks to confront and resolve each and every political challenge with violence and that reacts to its failure to achieve solutions to political um challenges with violence by applying even more violence that has an insatiable Lust For Palestinian territory um that you know a genocidal apartheid state that seems increasingly incapable of even conceiving of peaceful coexistence um uh with with the other people on that land um so I'm very pessimistic that a a solution is possible I look at um I grew up um in Western Europe in the long shadow of the second world war um I think we can all agree that there could have been no peace in Europe um had certain regimes on that continent not been removed from Power um I look at um uh southeast Asia and the late 1970s and I think we're all agreed that there could not have been peace in that region had the K Rouge uh not been ousted I look at Southern Africa during the 1990s and I think we can all be agreed that had the white minority regimes of um that ruled Zimbabwe and South Africa not been dismantled there could not have been peace in that region and although I think it's worth having a discussion um I do think it's now a legitimate question to ask can there be peace um without dismantling uh the Zionist uh regime and I make a very clear distinction between the Israeli state and its institutions on the one hand um and the Israeli people who I think regardless of our discussion uh about the history I think you can now talk about an Israeli people and a people um that have developed uh rights over time and um a formula for peaceful coexistence with them uh will need to be found which is a separate matter from uh dismantling um the Israeli state and its institutions and again I haven't reached clear conclusions about this except to say as a practical matter I think a two-state uh settlement remains uh uh feasible but I think there are very legitimate questions about its desirability um and about whether peace can be achieved in the Middle East um with the Persistence of an irrational genocidal aparti uh regime particularly because Israeli Society is um uh beginning to develop um many extremely extremely uh tasteful supremacist uh dehumanizing uh aspects that I think also stand in the way of uh coexistence that are being fed by this uh regime so if you look back into history when we're closest to peace and do you draw any hope from any of them um I feel like in 2000 I feel like the deal that was present uh at least at the end of the taba Summit I think in terms of what Israel I think had the to give and what the Palestinians would have gotten would have definitely been the most agreeable between the two parties um I don't know if in 73 I'm not sure if the appetite would have ever been there for the Arab states to negotiate alongside the Palestinians I know that um in Jordan there was no love for the Palestinians after you know 1970 after Black September um I know that sedat had no love for the Palestinians um due to their associ association with the Muslim brotherhoods attempted assassinations in Egypt um sorry which PLO in the Muslim Brotherhood Sadat was upset because there were attempted assassinations by people in oh no an assassination um it was a personal friend of his Yu alai I can't pronounce that was assassinated cyress by AED by the ab organization aded he says much belongs to group not directly but I think that um there was a history of um the Palestinians sometimes uh fighting with their neighboring states that were hosting them if they weren't getting the political concessions they wanted um the assassination of the Jordanian King in 51 might be another example of that in Jordan um it it feels like over a long period of time it feels like the Palestinians have been kind of told from the neighboring Arab states that if they just continue to enact violence whether in Israel or abroad that eventually a state will materialize somehow uh I don't think it's gotten them any closer to a state if anything I think it's taken them farther and farther and farther away from one and I think as long as the hyperbolic language is continually employed internationally the idea that Israel is committing a genocide the idea that there is an apartheid the idea that they live in a concentration camp all of these words I think further The Narrative for the Palestinians that Israel is an evil state that needs to be dismantled um I mean you said as much about the institution at least of the Zionist government uh Israel's government is probably not going anywhere all of the other surrounding Arab states have accepted that or at least most of them down in the Gulf Egypt and Jordan have accepted that uh the Palestinians need to accept it too the the Israeli State or the state apparatus is not going anywhere and at some point they need to realize like like hey we need a leader that's going to come out and represent us represent all of us is willing to take political risks is willing to negotiate some lasting peace for us and it's not going to be the International Community or some invocation of international law or some invocation of morality or Justice that's going to extricate us from this conflict it's going to take some actual difficult political maneuvering on the ground of accepting Israel of accepting Israel which they formally did in 1993 which they formally did in 1993 yeah but then no no lasting came after that in 2000 no because uh 1993 was not a peace agreement sure the oso courts wer final solution or an interim an interim agreement and um Palestinians actually began clamoring for commencing the the permanent status uh resolutions on schedule and the Israelis kept delaying them in fact they only began I believe in 99 under American pressure on on the Israelis I think you're being a bit one-sided both sides didn't fulfill the promise of Oso and the steps needed for Oso there was Palestinian terrorism which accompanied Israel's expansion of settlements and other things the two things fed each other and led to what happened in 2000 which was a breakdown of the talks altoe when the Palestinians said no but I I think there's a I I don't I don't agree incidentally with this definition of Israel or the Israeli State as a apartheid it's not there is a some sort of apartheid going on in the West Bank the Israeli regime itself is not an apartheid regime that is nonsense by any definition of aparti which well by by the formal definition I think it qualifies no it doesn't qualify a aparti is a race race-based distinction between different segments of the population and some of them don't have any representation at all like the blacks in South Africa no rights at all in Israel in Israel itself the the minority the Arabs do have representation do have rights and so on I don't think Israel is also genocidal I don't think it's been genocidal it wasn't so in 48 it wasn't so in ' 67 and it hasn't been recently in my view um and talk about dismantling Israel and that's what you're talking about um is I think Stephen said it correctly is counterproductive it just pushes Israelis further away from willing to give Palestinians anything please nor tell me you have something optimistic to say optimistic to say no I uh even though I agree I've thought about it a lot and I agree with M's uh analysis um I'm not really in the business of punditry I rather look at the historical record where I feel more comfortable and I feel on Terra Firma so I'd like to just go through that uh I don't quite I agree and I disagree with Moen on the 73 issue after the 1973 War uh it was clear that Israel was surprised by what happened during the war and um uh it took a big hit the estimates are I don't know what numbers you used but I hear between two and 3,000 Israeli soldiers were killed uh during the 19 2500 yeah 2700 okay so I got it right I read different numbers that's you know it's a very large number uh of Israelis who were killed there were moments at the beginning of the war where there was a fear that this might be it uh in there wasn't wasn't this is non everybody forgets isra Israel's Atomic Weaponry I know but so how could they have been defeated talk about the collapse of the third temp he did but that but it was hysterical and silly because isra hadic weapons they wanted to stop syrians or thep we're talking about perceptions yeah I'm not I'm not I can't tell you if he was historical or not no he was the same room with him I'm just saying let's not bog down on that uh the war is over and when President Carter comes into Power Carter was an extremely smart guy Jimmy Carter extremely smart guy and he was very fixed on details extreme he was probably the most impressive of modern American presidents in my opinion by a wide margin and he was determined to resolve the conflict uh on a on a big scale on the Arab Israeli scale on the palestin inian issue he wouldn't go past what he called a Palestinian Homeland he would Palestinian national home the Palestinian national home he wouldn't go as far as a Palestinian State uh I'm not going to go into the details of that I I don't think realistically given the political balance of forces that was going to happen but that's a separate issue let's get to the issue ah hand namely what is the obstacle or what has been the obstacle since the early 1970s since rough 1974 the Palestinians have accepted the two-state settlement in the June 1967 border now as it got as more pressure was exerted on Israel because the Palestinians seemed reasonable the Israelis to quote the Israeli political scientist avner Yan he since passed from the scene he said Yaniv in his book dilemas of security he said that the big palestin big Israeli fear was what he called the Palestinian peace offensive that was their worry that the Palestinians were becoming too moderate and unless you understand that you can't understand the June 1982 Lebanon war the purpose of the June 1982 Lebanon war was to liquidate the PLO in southern Lebanon because they were too moderate the Palestinian peace offensive I'm going to have to fast forward there are many events there's the first in then there's the oo court and let's now go to uh the the the heart of the issue namely the uh the 2201 negotiations well um the negotiations are divided into three parts for the sake of listeners there's Camp David in July 2000 there are the Clinton parameters in December 2000 and then there are negotiations in taba in Egypt taba in Egypt in 2001 those are the three phases now I have studied the record probably to the point of insanity because there are so many details you have to master I'll I'll vouch for that the insanity I I actually I will vouch for it I will personally vouch for it um there is one extensive record from that whole period from 2000 to you could say 2007 and that is what came to be called the Palestine papers which were about 15,000 pages of all the records of the negotiations I have read through all of them every single page and this is what I find if you look at shomo Ben Ami's book which I have with me prophets without honor it's his last book he says going into Camp David that means July going into Camp David July 2000 he said the Israelis were willing to return about not return but will withdraw from 90 relinquish uh 92% of the West Bank benam me was at Camp DAV yeah Ben he was at taba oh yeah he was also Camp DAV uh they wanted Israel wanted to keep all the major settlement blocks it wanted to keep roughly 8% of the West Bank they were allowing for you put it at 84 to 90% uh in your books uh they put it at roughly 92% uh Israel was willing to give how you calculate depends what stage Camp David because there were two weeks I'll get to that proposals changed during so Israel wants to keep all the major settlement blocks means the Border area of the West well not the Border we have Ariel we have Mal adumim we have asit as Condit rice called arel she said it was a dagger Into the Heart of the West Bank so they want to keep 8% of the land they want to keep the settlement blocks they want to keep 80 % of the settlers they will not budge an inch on the question of refugees to quote uh Ehud Barack in the article he co-authored with you in the New York Review of Books we will accept and I think the quotes accurate no moral legal or historical responsibility for what happened to the refugees so forget about even allowing refugees to return we accept no moral legal or historical responsibility for the refugees and on Jerusalem they wanted to keep large parts of Jerusalem now how do we judge who is reasonable and who is not benami says I think the Israeli offer was reasonable that's how he sees it but what is the standard of reasonable my standard is what do international law say international law says the settlements are illegal Israel wants to keep all the settlement blocks 15 judges all 15 in the wall decision in 2004 in July 2004 all 15 judges including the American judge bergenthal ruled the settlements are illegal under international law they want to keep 80% of the settlers under international law all the settlers are illegal in the West Bank they want to keep large parts of East Jerusalem but under international law East Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory that's what the international not Palestinian because there was no palestin there's never been a Palestinian State how could it be Palestinian I listen patiently to you sorry under international law if you read the decision all territory not 2004 World decision all territory beyond the green line which includes East Jerusalem is occupied Palestinian territory the exception of the Goan Heights the designated unit according to the international court of justice the designated unit for Palestinian self-determination and they they deny any right whatsoever on the right of return the maximum I don't want to go into the details now the maximum formal offer was by AUD Omar in 2008 he offered 5,000 refugees could return under what was called family reunification 5,000 in the course of five years and no recognition of any Israeli responsibility so if you use as the Baseline what the UN General Assembly has said and what the international court of justice has said if you use that Baseline international law by that Baseline all the concessions came from the Palestinian side every single concession came from the Palestinian side none came from the Israeli side they may have accepted less than they with than what they wanted but it was still beyond what international law allocated to them now you say allocated to the Palestinians allocated to the Palestinians yes thank you for the clarification now about Arafat like the Muti never liked the guy I think that was one of the only disagreements uh maren and I had when Arafat passed you were a little sentimental I was not never like the guy but politics you don't have to like the guy there was no question nobody argues it that whenever the negotiation started up the Palestinians just kept saying the same things no and no they kept saying no no Professor Mars with due respect respect incorrect they kept saying International legitimacy international law un resolutions they said we already gave you what you what the Lord required we gave that in 1988 November 1988 and then ratified again at Oslo in 1993 and they said now we want what was promised us under International law and that was the one point where everybody on the other side agreed Clinton don't talk to me about international law Livy during the Omar Administration she said I studied international law I don't believe in international law every single member on the other side they didn't want to hear from international law and to my thinking that that is the only reasonable Baseline for trying to resolve the conflict and Israel has along with when has when has International La been relevant to any conflict basically in the world hey that's why over the last that's why the Palestinians have to recognize Israel because that's international law that was UN resolution Sol by international law or in accordance with international law but then Professor Maris for argument's sake let's agree on that strictly for argument sake what's the alternative Dennis Ru said we're going to decide who gets what on the basis of needs so he says Israel needs this Israel needs that Israel needs that Dennis Ross decide to be the philosopher king he's going to decide on the basis of needs well if you asked me since Gaza is one of the densest places on Earth it needs a good it needs it needs part of it needs a nice big chunk of well not that's what it actually needs okay I I don't even want to go there uh it needs a nice big chunk but I have to accept international law says no okay international law is irrelevant now Ben says I think the Israeli offer was reasonable okay that's he reasonable that's he seems even though okay I don't want to go there I've debated him and partly agree with you um but who decides what's reasonable I think the International Community in its political uh Incarnation the general assembly the security Council all those un Security Council resolution saying the settlements are illegal annexation of East Jerusalem is null and void and the international court of justice that to me is a reasonable standard and by that standard the Palestinians were asked to make concessions which I consider unreasonable or the International Community considers unreasonable I think that the issue is when you apply international law or International standards I I wouldn't say what Benmore says that they're irrelevant but I think that these have to be seen as informing the conversation I don't think these are the final of the conversation I don't think historically Israel has ever negotiated within the strict bounds of whether we're talking resolution 242 whether we're talking about any G General Assembly resolutions that's just not how these negotiations tend to go you might consider International opinion on things but at the end of the day it's the bilateral negotiations often times historically started in secret independent of the International Community um that end up shaping what the final agreements look like I think the issue with this broad appeal to international law is again going back to my earlier point about all of the euphemistic words all it simply does is Drive Palestinian expectations up to a level that is never going to be satisfied uh for instance you can throw that icj opinion all you want it was an advisory opinion that came in 2004 have Palestinians gained more or less land since that 2004 advisory opinion was issued what would your standard be then both sides have to have a delegation that confronts each other and they assess the realistic conditions on the ground and they try to figure out within the confines of international law both sides are reasonable but like forance this statement of like full with Retreat from the West what is it 400,000 sett how many settlers live in the west now probably half a million depends if you include the Jerusalem suburbs four or 500,000 people are never with the Jerusalem suburbs perhaps half a million people not settlements I know that but that's not what the law the law calls it null and void we can say we can say whatever we want until we're blue in the face but like there's half a million Israeli people are not being expelled resp you're basically saying if I understand correctly there's only one way to resolve this and that is through direct bilateral negotiations probably yeah okay so or ideally but I've taken over your house okay you're not going to go to the police because you know the law is of only of limited value so you come over and sit in what is now my living room that used to be your living room and we negotiate the problem there is that you're not going to get anything unless I agree to it and standard and and norms and and law and all the rest of it be damned so um you need to take into account that when you're advocating bilateral negotiations that effectively that gives each of the parties veto power and in the current circumstances the Palestinians have already recognized Israel um they have they have why you keep bringing that up like it's a significant concession even it's not even true it does the recognition from Palestine isn't doing anything for Hamas totally reject Hamas Hamas is a majority in the among the Palestinian people they won the elections in 2006 every they won a majority of the seats didn't win majority opinion poll today says the majority of Palestinians support the Hamas Hamas absolutely rejects hisra so if arat 2003 uh 1993 or whatever issued a sort of recognition was a sort of recogn recognition of Israel it does it's meaningless it's meaningless any any I don't believe that Arafat was sincere about it does it matter what you I think well most Israelis do and that does matter okay so that does matter but Hamas says no and Hamas is the majority to so for years so so for years the Israeli and US demand was that the Palestinians recognize uh 242 338 they did but you're saying okay we demanded that they do this but it was meaningless when they did it then the then the demand was that a tactical thing yes then the demand was that is uh the PLO recognize Israel tactical okay we demanded that they did this and they did it but it's meaningless and they never changed their chart of the PLO you may remember that in fact in 19 they supposedly abrogated the Old Charter but never came up with a new one so no there's no new CH but in 1996 and Faruk Kumi said of course the Old Charter is still in yes but the point is you know the Palestinians demands are constantly made of them and when they and when they acceed to those demands they're then told actually what you did is meaningless so here's a new set of Demands I mean you know it's like a hamster ofand it's like a hamster it's like a hamster Stu in whe let me tell you what told if you run fast enough you'll get out of the cave no no the bottom line is that Israel would like a Palestinian Sadat it wants the Palestinians listen listen this really a worst case scenario okay let me just they sh s but anyhow the the the Israelis want want the Palestinians Israelis want the Palestinians to actually accept the legitimacy of the state of Israel and the Zionist project and then live side by side with them in two states that's what the Israelis I don't even know don't that's true today and what is the formal position of of of this Israeli government no no I'm saying I don't know if it exist it's it's predecessor and it's predecessor and it's come on that's what Israelis want they want a change of of psyche among the Palestinians if that doesn't happen there won't be a palestin m mine has an interesting point because interal because I found I found I know you would want to I know you want to forget it just like you want to forget the genocide charge but I know you want to forget that well the Palestinians want to forget it too and it doesn't suit them as well right but here's the problem and it's exactly the problem that M just brought up now I read carefully your book one state two states with all due respect absolutely a disgrace coming coming from you coming from you most reviewers didn't agree with you yeah coming from you was like you wrote it in your sleep it's nothing compared to what you wrote before I don't know why you did it in my opinion you ruined your reputation not totally but you undermined it with that book but let's get to the issue that M wrote here's what you said you said formerly you said yes it's true the Palestinians recognize Israel but then you said viscerally in their hearts they they didn't really recognize Israel so I thought to myself how does uh Professor Mar no what's in the hearts of Palestinians I don't know I was I was I was explained I was I was surprised as a historian you would be talking about what's lurking in the hearts of Palestinians but then you said something which was really interesting in you said even if in their hearts they accepted Israel you said quote rationally they could never accept Israel because they got nothing they had this beautiful Palestine and now they're reduced to just a few pieces a few Parcels of land they will never accept it so yes so you said there's no way they can accept no I I would say that as well the two State solution as proposed exactly as Moen said you keep moving the gold post no no no until we reach the point where we realize according to Benny Maris there can't be a solution so why don't you just say that outright why don't you say it outright that according to you the Palestinians can never be reasonable because according to you they want all according to you they couldn't possibly they couldn't possibly agree to a two-state summon because it's such a lousy settlement Palestine because you but you said rationally they couldn't accept it not their feelings you said rational you went from formally viscerally rationally so now we're reaching the point where according to Benny moris the Palestinians can't be reasonable because reasonably they have to reject two states they want all of pal absolutely correct there's no way to resolve the problem according to your he said that himself he said they should dismantle Israel that's what he say what I said what I said and and I've and I've written I'm glad you didn't deny it I've I've written extensively on this issue on on why a two-state settlement is um still feasible and I came out in support of that proposition perhaps in my heart you know you can see that I was just bullshitting but that's what I actually wrote that was a number of years ago and and just as a matter of historical record um beginning in the early 1970s um there was fierce debate within the Palestinian national movement about whether to accept or reject and and there were three schools of thought there was one that would accept nothing less than the total liberation of Palestine there was a second that accepted what was called the establishment of a fighting National Authority on Palestinian soil which they saw as the begin as a springboard for the total liberation of Palestine and there was a third school that believed that under current Dynamics and so on that that um they should go for a two-state settlement and and our friend and correspondent cter lers has written a very perceptive article on um when the P already in 1976 came out an open support of a um two-state uh resolution at the security Council poo accepted it Israel of course rejected it but the resolution didn't pass because the US and the UK vetoed it it was both of them I think it was N9 to5 yeah but but fact of the matter is that the PLO came to accept um a two-state settlement why they did it I think is irrelevant um and subsequently the PLO acted on the basis of seeking to achieve a two-state sett the reason I think and I think Norm you've written about this the reason that Arafat was so insistent on getting um uh the minimally acceptable terms for a two-state settlement at Camp David and afterwards was precisely because he knew that once he signed that was all the Palestinians were going to get if his intention had been you know I'm not accepting Israel I simply want to springboard he would have accepted a Palestinian state in Jericho but he didn't he ins that's something I've never understood he should have logically accepted the springboard and then from there launched his next stage don't understand he international law would put a real constraint on no but also he accepted it was over constitutionally he was incapable of signing know you're right that he he should have accepted it but if you're correct okay that that he was really out to eliminate Israel then then he wouldn't have cared about the borders he wouldn't have cared about what the thing said about refugees he would have gotten a sovereign state and used that to achieve that purpose but but I think it was precisely because he recognized that he was not negotiating for a springboard he was negotiating permanent status that he was such a stickler about the details the second just as a factual matter he wasn't such a stickler when they asked him how many refugees the numbers it was a principal rather than the num principal he said I would be pragmatic about it and the numbers that were used at um Annapolis were between and 250,000 refugees over 10 years that was the number Arafat when he was asked at Camp David he kept saying I care about the Lebanese uh the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon which came to about 300,000 prior which was a large concession from the whether you accept the number or not that he wasn't talking about 6 million he was talking about between 100 and 250,000 over 10 years now the best offer that came from the Palestinians excuse me the best offer that came from Israel was the allart offer can we just pretend like we didn't all lay out the exceptionally pessimistic uh view of a two-state hold on a second two-state solution let's pretend that in 5 years and 10 years a a two-state peace settlement is reached and and as historians you will still be here and writing about it 20 years from now how would it have happened I think that historically I think that the big issue is I think that both sides have had their own internal motivations to fight because they feel like they have something to gain from it but I think as time has gone on unfortunately the record proves that the Palestinian side is delusional the longer that the conflict endures the worse position they'll be in but for some reason they've never had a leader that convinced them of that as much that Arafat thought that if he held on there was always a better deal around the corner um abas is more concerned with trying to maintain any legitimacy amongst Palestinians than actually trying to uh negotiate anything realistic with Israel that Palestinians are always incen to feel like as long as they keep fighting either the International Community is going to save them with the 5 millionth UN resolution condemning whatever that another icj advisory opinion is finally going to lead to the expulsion of half a million Jews from the West Bank or that some other International body uh the icj and the genocide Char is going to come and save the Palestinians as long as they in their mind feel like somebody is coming to save them then they feel like they're going to have the ability to get something better in the future but the reality is is all of the good partners for peace that the Palestinians had have completely and utterly abandoned them uh Egypt uh Jordan uh the Gulf States uh whether you're talking bilateral peace or the Abraham Accords most of the Arab leaders in negotiating peace with Israel have just not had as much of an interest in maintaining the uh maintaining the rights and the representations of what the Palestinian people want and the only people they have today to to draw legitimacy from or to have on their side to argue with them are people that I guess write books or tweet or people in the International Community that do resolutions or Amnesty International reports and the reality is we can scream until we're blew in the face on these things none of it has gotten any closer to helping the Palestinians in any sense of the word the condition has only gotten worse the settlements only continue to expand the military operations are only going to get more brutal uh the the blockade is going to continue to have worse effects as long as we use international law as the basis and there isn't a strong a Sadat likee Palestinian leader that's willing to come up and confront Israel with the with the brave peaceful negotiations to force them to to acqu nothing is going to happen and I think that the issue you come up with is you know whether it's people like Norm that talk about how Brave the October 7th attacks were or how much respect they have for those Fighters the the Israel in a way and I think people have said as much about Netanyahu um the right wants violence from the Palestinians because it always gives them a Perpetual excuse to further the conflict well we have to go in uh in October 7 we've got to remove Hamas well we can't trust these people in the west we have to do the night raids um because you know the second inata uh you know made us feel like the Palestinian people didn't want trust with us I feel like the the the biggest thing that would force Israel to change its path would be an actual a real not for like two weeks but an actual peaceful Palestinian leader somebody committed to peace that is able to apply those standards and hold the entire region of Palestine to those standards because I think over time the mounting pressure from without the the the International Community and the mounting pressure from within because Israel hosts a lot of its own criticism if we talk about bet Salem we talk her like Israel will host a lot of its own criticism I think that that pressure would force Israel towards an actual peace agreement but it's never going to come through violence historically it hasn't um and in the modern day violence has just hurt the Palestinians more and more if you paint a picture of the future now is a good moment for both Palestine and Israel to get new leadership Netanyahu is on the way out Hamas possibly is on the way out who should rise to the top such that a peaceful settlement can be reached the the problem is like said yeah it's difficult because Hamas enjoys so much widespread support um amongst the Palestinian people I think that the well I don't know there's opinions on whether democracy or pushing them towards elections was the right or wrong idea but with like an Islamic fundamentalist government for for Hamas I don't know if a negotiation with Israel ever happens there and then when the when the international pressure is always you know 67 borders infinite right of return for refugees and a total withdrawal of Israel from all these lands to even start negotiations um I just don't see realistically that on the Palestinian side no negotiations are ever going to start in in a place that Israel is willing to accept if you want to um dismiss international law that's fine but then you have to do it consistently you can't um set standards for the Palestinians um but reject uh applying those standards to Israel um if we're going to have the law of the Jungle then we can all be beasts and not only some of us and I think so it's either that or you have certain agreed uh standards that that are intended to regulate our conduct all of our conduct not just some of us I'm saying to abandon well you're saying you know international law and the millionth UN resolution you're being very dismissive about all the things and that's fine but then you have to be dismissive say like forance AC that was a chapter 6 resolution that's non-binding but 242 is binding what is what is binding do you know anything about how the UN system if you read the language of the resolution binding is typically if it commits you to upholding a particular international law or if it establish you just throw out words you hear binding even does 22 mention a Palestinian state of course part of the problem that was the reason why the Palestinians didn't want to recognize 242 because it only referred at the very end recognized 181 and 22 hold on hold on every United Nations security Council resolution irrespective of under which chapter it was adopted is by definition binding binding not only on the members of the security Council but on every member state of the UN that's read the UN Charter it's it's black and what sure people look the language even of 242 is kept intentionally vague such that it doesn't actually provide again the final not that vague because the term the term land for peace originates in 242 the idea territorial acquisition and Israel's need to give it up was kept vague that's why in that's why 79 is thought that they their point of information allow me points of information the first principle in UN resolution 242 is the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force which is meaning it may be meaningless to you Mr B M Mr benell that principle was adopted by the friendly Nations resolution the UN General Assembly in 1970 that resolution was then reiterated in the international court of justice ruling advisory opinion in 2004 that was the basis of the Coalition against Iraq when it acquired Kuwait and then declared it a province of Kuwait which supported that's what's called that's what's called not accurate I'm not going to go there I'm not it's not accurate that ended okay I'm not going to go there uh under international law use kogan or peremptory Norms of international law the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war that is not controversial it's not vague you couldn't put it more succinctly you cannot acquire territory by force under international law on the west before 67 who on the STP before 6 M Mr benel don't change the subject if you don't know what you're talking about at least have the at least humil close has2 gotten to the from tweet five you have no idea what you're talking about it's just so embarrassing at least have some humility between us we have read maybe 10,000 books on the topic and you've read two wik media entries and you start talking about chapter 6 do you know what chapter seven is answer me chapter answer me a question how close is 242 gotten the Palestinians to a state how close is the 2004 advisory opinion gotten the the West Bank settlement what's your alternative the alternative is you it's not this whatever this making money off the conflict is the the actual alternative the actual alternative should talk about making money you're media will you go and talk to 50 million different people about your awes the issue is you these resolutions have gotten the Palestinians no closer because they haven't enforced because of the US V they're not going to be enforc wait wait wait if I may if I may Professor talk about the case for genocide Professor Maris because of your logic and I'm not disputing it that's why October 7th happened oh my God because there was no options left for those people exactly and now what options are left after October only optionen only is now an expert on Palestinian mentality you're contradicting mentality Egypt didn't find it necessary Egypt didn't find it necessary to negotiate peace with pales Jordan didn't find it necessary to negotiate peace with the Palestinian cours didn't didn't the palan all of the international law you're contradicting yourself on the one hand you're saying all the Palestinians do was fight and violence and terrorism and all the rest of it but on the other hand you're saying they're expecting salvation from uh uh from un resolutions and international cour those aren't violent they're no but it's part of maintaining it's the it's the continual putting off of negotiating any solution they' negoti as when arat Tak 10 days to respond when arat takes 10 days to respond all over the world yes put they AC the two states in 1975 brace yourself they years ago half century ago they didn't accept the two State solution very good article you can quote Arafat talking about how he's lying and he's just going to use a 94 and a 95 when he's making trips around the world how he just want the starting ground I I'm sorry I can talk slow you can watch YouTu Slow Down to5 Speed if you don't understand what I'm saying let me there's a very there's a very lengthy history of Israeli Palestinian negotiations you want to deny that those NE negotiations took place where it feels like there was a a good faith effort where where there was a good faith effort where it was a good faith effort record all due respect we have a written Mr Pop you can't even read the written records I don't know why you're referring to excuse me I just said there are 15,000 pages on Annapolis and I'm sure you Cherry quied your favorite quotes from all of them okay that's great great at least I a quote to charity great want I gave you quotes I give you you want quotes find me the information the Palestinian cause has been furthered by any international law you can't do it I think the problem is is is different okay you you want to um say the Palestinians were only fighting and then when I point out they've also gone to the court and the UN say well all they do then as these things and you said they should be negotiating and I demonstrate that there was a lengthy um uh record of negotiations said yeah but they didn't go in good faith again you're placing the hamster in the wheel and telling him if he runs fast enough maybe one day he'll get out of the cage what was the best negation if I could just finish I I think the fundamental problem here is not what the Palestinians have and haven't done and it's perfectly legitimate to have a discussion about whether they could have been more effective of course they could have been more effective everyone could have always been more effective the fundamental issue here is that Israel has never been prepared to concede the legitimacy of Palestinian national rights in the land of the former British Mandate of palestin how do you explain taba Summit how do you explain the did how do youy of Palestinian demands this is but they just didn't want to give the Palestinians all of Palestine that's all no all of Palestine of pal you mean all of the occupied territories you're talking about all of Palestine what the occup what is the occupied territories the occupied territor all Israel the occupied territories are those territories that Israel occupied in June of 1967 pans often use that term to define the whole of pal not just the West Bank could you show me Professor Morris in all the negotiations all the negotiations and all the accounts that have written can you show me one where the Palestinians in the negotiations cuz that's what we were talking about wanted all of Israel the maximum I they can't say that because International Community won't accept it they didn't say it they didn't ask for it Hamas did Hamas always said Hamas only negotiated with Israel about prisoner exchanges in so we were talking a lot of the palan people will agre the only place I saw pieces of Israel were the land swaps and the land swaps accounted for about 2 to 5% of Israel nobody asked for all of Israel why what do you mean they asked for all of Israel in 48 they asked for all of Israel in 67 what do you think those were about you're not going to respond to anything I'm saying you have no answer respond to you that's correct okay Mr benel we were talking about the Diplomatic negotiations beginning with 20 200021 can't pretend that the for isra was in diplomacy it was through War you don't know what you're talking about is the international law argument ever going to get the Palestinians closer to St is the Israeli State ever going to be dismantled do you think that's like realistic coming up ever in the next 20 years again I'm I'm posing a question um and the question is regardless of of of what's feasible or realistic today um the question I'm posing is can you have peace in the Middle East with this militant irrational genocidal aparti State and power L I don't think so now okay and the question I'm asking is can you have peace with this regime or does this regime and its institutions need to be dismantled similar to what the examples I gave of of of Europe and southern Africa how do you contend with the fact that most of the surrounding Arab states seem to agree that you can yeah you're correct um several of them most importantly Egypt uh Jordan have made their peace um uh with Israel I should add that Israel's conduct since then has placed these uh relations under strain I I had very little um uh I didn't take uh the reports of a Saudi Israeli rushma particularly seriously before October 7th the reason being that it was really a Saudi Israeli us deal which committed the US um to make certain commitments to Saudi Arabia that would probably never get through um Congress you not consider the Egypt Israeli peace deal legitimate then since is since the United States made a great financial contribution to Egypt I don't think the question is whether that deal is um uh legitimate or not I think I think that deal um uh exists but the point is um whether you know the the the core of this conflict is not between Israel and Egypt the core of this conflict is between Israel and the Palestinian people and the reason that Israel agreed to relinquish um the occupied Egyptian sin and the reason that Egyption Israeli peace treaty was signed in 1979 is because Israel in 1973 recognized that its military super superiority was ultimately no match for Egypt's determination to recover its occupied territories and that there would come a point when Egypt would find a way to extract an unbearable price maybe just the Israelis wanted peace well the Israelis not just because they were afraid of what Egypt might do if you're talking about the average Israeli citizen I I think that's a fair characterization if you're talking about the Israeli leadership I think they looked at it in more strategic terms how do you remove the most powerful two point two point simple points what was the terms of that Egypt Israel peace treaty international law Egypt demanded every nobody cared about interal allow me to finish every single inch no about international law uhur and sad talked about the reality territory Professor Maris Professor Maris I know the record they demanded as you know cuz you've written about they demanded every square inch as you know they demanded the oil fields be dismantled the Airfield no not dismantled they wanted the oil field they wanted the settlements dismantled settlements dismantled the settlements the oil fields and the Airfield they demanded all three back you can't have what do you mean back the airfields weren't there when the EG were there okay that's incorrect what's you're incorrect they built an Airfield the Israelis built an Airfield in the occupied and they wanted it back they didn't want it back wasn't their okay they wanted the territory in which they is built back oil fields the airfields the settlements have to be dismantled yes ban said I don't want to be the first prime minister to dismantle settlement but he did why because of the law because of ital the law law had nothing to do anything it was a negotiation between two states Each of which wanted certain the law had nothing to do said repeatedly in the negotiations you're not listening you're missing the point read the negotiations nothing to do two foreign relations of us volumes on it nobody cares about the law the Palestinians kept saying we want ex the palan they weren't there allow me to finish the Palestinians kept saying we want what Egypt got we want what Egypt got Egypt got everything back nothing to do with the law okay nothing to do with and number two I'm not saying it's the whole picture but as foreign minister MOA Dean said at the time he said if a car has four wheels and you remove one wheel the car can't move and for them removing Egypt from the Arab front would then remove any Arab military threat to Israel m m was no the first part did and that's what the Palestinians kept saying what Egypt got from that's true but forget into National Law and by the way to do one last thing one last on a personal note the quote about charm Shake without peace okay that's the only thing you ever cited from a book of mine you I cited from your book yes I was absolutely shocked at your betrayal of your people that was your treason it was I apologize for that I apologize I apologize I accept all right well let me try once again uh for the region and for just entirety of humanity what gives you hope we just heard a lot of pessimistic cynical takes what gives you hope don't like War that's that's a good reason that's hope in other words the fear of war the dis disaster of War should give people an a impetus to try and seek peace when you look the people in Gaza and people in the West Bank people in Israel fundamentally no but fundamentally they hate War yes I think so what what gives you hope there is no hope no it's an extreme no I'm hey I'm not happy to say that of course you are it's a it's a very Bleak moment right now because that I agree with I agree with that Israel believes it has to restore what it calls its uh deterrence capability I think you've written about it actually I just realized Israel has to restore its deterrence cap capability and after the catastrophe of October 7th restoring its deterrence capacity means this part you didn't write about the annihilation of Gaza and then moving on to the Hezbollah no so so the Israelis are dead set on restoring that deterrence capability on the Arab side and I Know M and I have disagreed on it and we're allowed to disagree um I think the Arab side the lesson they learned from October 7th is Israelis aren't as strong as we thought they were and that will be an unfortunate unfortunate message that's really what the come to think and they think that there is a military option now and I think that that's it's a zero sum game at this point and it's very very B and I'm not going to lie about that now I will admit my predictive capacities are perfect are limited but for the moment it's a very Bleak situation that I agree with and I don't see right now a way out however at the very minimum permanent ceasefire ended inh human and illegal blockade of Gaza and uh why is it illegal they were shooting rockets at Israel for for 20 years why is that illegal to blockade Gaza he thinks bottle Ro why is it illegal I'll tell you why you don't rocket your neighbor you rocket your neighbor expect consequences I'll tell expect consequences but that works both way I know professor professor both I'll tell you why because every human rights humanitarian and un organization in the world has said said nobody cares it's a form of collective punishment illegal under International La you think you think a blockade you don't understand the way the world works these things are irrelevant and you think confining because that's the blockade yes you don't confing confining a million children confining that's the choice comining million children in what the economist called a human rubbish sheep The Economist supported Israel in this war and continued to support Israel what um International Committee of Red Cross called a sinking ship with the UN High Commissioner for human rights called a toxic slum you think it is a slum of course SL you think but it's caused under international law you think it's legitimate hey I know you want to forget the law one thing that every what every Israeli fears the most the LA as Cy ly said I studied international law I oppose international law of course you don't want to hear about the law it's got nothing to do anything okay so here's the thing yeah then don't complain about October 7th if you don't want if you want to say forget about the law all I said was like Barb there is no International humanitarian law There's no distinction between civilians and combatants be and so now you're doing what Meen said you're becoming very selective about the law if you want to forget about the law Hamas had every right to do what it did it had every right to do what it did according to you not to me cuz you want to forget the law do you still support the houthis shooting random ships absolutely okay that's a violation of international law you play the same game absolutely and were there a power during World War II who had the courage of the houthis where there a power that had that kind of cage to be bombing Merchant ships while tens of thousands of people die of actual starvation not the starvation that exists in the Gaza Strip where people before October don't die of starvation not that not the concentration C the what about starvation in Yen don't they have something better to do was the hoies yes I know don't don't they have anything in three years 180,000 should they be feeding 60,000 why fight starvation why fight the Western powers in Israel when you should be taking care of your problems at home the htis often the only allies of the dispossessed are those who experience similar circumstances don't you think that they should take take care of the Yemen yemeni problems I'm very happy I'm very happy they're helping out the Palestinians anyone who helps expense of anybody for anybody who comes to the aid of those suffering a genocide half of half of whom are children yeah according to the most current un reports as of today one quarter of the population of Gaza is starving that means 500,000 children are starving are on the verge of famine they keep saying on the verge of on thege not seen I have not seen one Palestinian die of starvation in these last four months not one on the verge on the verge they have been documented cases I haven't seen yesterday aler said six and the day before that they said two so those are the the two the that number probably dies in Israel of starvation also I don't think there's famine in Israel there isn't there isn't in the Gaza Strip either it's something which is produced for the Western there are infants dying due to a engineered lack of access to food and nutrition I don't think it's engineered I think if the Kamas stopped shooting perhaps unfortunately as you said engineered I think um amnesty and excuse me human Rights Watch called it using starvation as a weapon that's called engineering okay that's what they did but you were pushed on this by Coleman Hughes to bring up like an example of why is the Gaza Strip like what by what metric are they starving by what metric is it so behind the rest of the world you know if we're going to bring up um I want to hear and answer that CU he didn't answer I'm happy to answer it yeah I just quoted you from the humanitarian organizations they said one quarter of the population of Gaza is now verging on famine before October 7 before October going before October you use that as justification Hamas fighting you say the conditions were unlivable they had to fight I said to him so my question is what made it unlivable prior to October 7th what are the what are the metrics that you're using there were about five six or seven reports issued by unad issued by the World Bank issued by the international monetary fund and they all said that's why that's why why did they say why why did they say that's why the economist not a radical periodical described Gaza as a human rubbish so tell me by what metrics if you're if you're a historian if you do all this work to do things tell me what they said tell me by what he's not going to answer again I I don't think I've avoided any of your questions except except when they breach when they breach the threshold of complete imbecility to tell me by what metric the Gaza Strip is a human crisis you remember what I said a moment ago I said to Professor Mars I defer to expertise I I look at what the organizations say I look at what the United Nations High Commissioner for human rights that you don't know you don't know you don't care I don't know you know how complicated have you ever investigated how complicated is the metric for Hunger starvation and famine it is such a complicated metric they figured out if you asked me to repeat it now I couldn't do it and yet we have a human development index where we rank countries yet we can still measure infant mortality life expect yeah we can measure all of these things I'm holding out for you here you still didn't answer the Hope question what gives you a source of Hope about the region well first of all I would agree with beny Morris and and Norman finklestein um that the current situation is Bleak and I think it would be um unreasonable to expect it to not get even Bleaker uh in the coming week and months and we now this conflict really it originated in the late 19th century it's been um been a more or less active conflict since the 1920s 1930s um and has produced a tremendous amount of of of suffering and and regional conflict and geopolitical complications and all of that uh but what gives me hope is is that throughout their entire ordeal um the paltin people have never surrendered um and I believe they never will surrender to overwhelming force and violence they have taken everything that Israel has thrown at them they have taken everything that the West has thrown at them they have taken everything that those who are supposed to be their natural allies have um uh on occasion uh thrown at them but um this is the people that never has and I believe never will surrender and um at a certain point I think um Israel uh and its leaders um will have to come to the realization that by hook or by crook um these people are going to achieve their inalienable and legitimate um uh National rights and and that that is going to be a reality I I um as I what do you mean by that you mean all of Palestine is that what you mean no and and from The River To The Sea well ideally of course yes um and and what I was those the inalienable rights no what I was saying earlier and then the discussion got sidetracked is um that I did believe that a two-state settlement um a partition of Palestine um along the 1967 uh boundaries um would have been a reasonable um solution because I think it also would have opened Pathways to um further but now you believe what further nonviolent engagement between Israel and the Palestinians that could create um other forms of coexistence in a in a federal or bational or or what do you think about refugees in regards to that do you think there has to be a resettlement of the five or six million whoever wants to lay claim to be I think I think there has to be an explicit acknowledgment um of uh respons of of a responsibility and and the return and of their rights I think that in the framework of a two-state settlement I think a formula would need to be found that does not undermine um uh the foundations um uh of a two-state settlement and I don't think it would be that difficult because I suspect that there are probably large numbers of um Palestinian refugees who once their rights are acknowledged will find it um exceptionally distasteful Canada exceptionally distasteful um to have to live among the kind of sentiments that we've heard around this table um today to be quite Frank I mean I heard I you know I'm I was previously unfamiliar with you um and and I watched one of your preparation videos uh very disconcerting stuff I have to say you were explaining two days ago in the discussion about apartheid and how absurd it was that in your view Jim Crow was not apartheid Jim Crow was not apartheid but Arab states not giving citizenship to Palestinian refugees is apartheid that's what I meant with my earlier comments about white supremacy so my issue that's great the white supremacy comment well hold on let me let me respond my issue is that I feel like we have jumped on this euphemistic treadmill and I think that's part of the reason why this conflict will never get solved is because on one end you've got a people who are now convinced internationally that they're victims of apartheid genocide concentration camp conditions uh ethnic cleansing uh they're forced to live in an open air prison um with all of these things that are stacked against them all of these terms that are highly specific that refer to to very precise things uh and then when people like nothing less from someone who doesn't think Crow is a part I don't know who does stat the problem is you're morally loading for you a part is when racists do bad things no there's there's a definition of a part that's great top down racial domination enacted through top down like federal legislative policies or whatever means that I don't know if um I don't know if Jim Crow would have qualified for part that doesn't make it any less excus mein I'm talking right now excuse me excuse me twinklin I'm talking to your friend over here um I don't know would have qualified as the crime of aarth just like if Israel were to literally nuke the Gaza St and kill 2 million people I don't know if that would qualify for the crime of In Your Eyes probably not I don't well yeah but because genocide requires a special intent I think the issue is instead instead of and I think this conversation is actually is emblematic of the entire conversation I don't think anything let me finish answering accus me of supporting racism so yeah I think I did it do you think I support Jim croww look when the fact that you can't even answer that honestly say that 800 civilian killed by by Hamas you said well maybe 400 were killed by Israel I don't know the number maybe you said 400 you co-signed the opinion no I didn't no I didn't well wait how many I think the word was some that's what I heard well you weren't listening how many people do you think approximately if you had to ball if you had to Ballpark it how many do you think were killed by Hamas on October 7th I think it's pretty clear that the majority of civilians that were killed 51% or 90% don't ask me to put a number those are two very different inition first of all are you when you say Hamas do you mean Palestinians or do you mean Hamas specif Palestinian Force I don't like to say Palestinians because I don't think all Palestinian civilians were inv ATT I'll say Hamas Islamic whatever Al that's how this discussion started you said Hamas and I began to answer that and then Benny moris said actually he means Hamas in addition to Jihad and the others so so of the invading Palestinian Force how many do you think killed civilians versus the IDF what do you think the ballpark the percentage well the figures we have are that about a third of the casualties on October 7th were military about two3 were what's your question how many what percentage of civilians think were killed by the invading Force I think I think a clear majority but I can't give you a specific figure if you thought it was close to 51% or 99% we killed by why would he know that how would he know because it's interesting to actually stake out a position it's you want to be completely agnostic on it they stop complete ignorance because we don't know professor moris doesn't know you can speak with absolute certainty that the IDF is targeting and murdering Palestinian children intentionally you see the double standard no I don't you see I know you don't it was aoral question obviously don't why because because the matter I looked at the UN report I looked at the report no the UN report on the great March of return in 2018 and they said that the snipers were targeting children Medics journalists and this AED people just as they are now in this confence exactly no more journalists have been killed in the last several months in Gaza than in any other conf world war Hamas is not killing journalists you agree that they operate in civilian uniforms that their goal is to induce that confusion that that's the the way that they conduct themselves militarily let me finish my point more journalists have been more children he doesn't want to hear it's soor you're not having a material it is virt yes like when you see children over and over again that's virt talking how many Israelis were killed that's not virtue signaling cuz that's human life I don't care about I don't care if 100 or thousand to1 curious ass the question yes that's not the number that's the response and then m m mentions that more journalists were killed in Gaza than in all of World War II it doesn't get that doesn't any part of Medics were killed that's that's silly journalist says it's virtu but when Israelis get killed that's serious I never said it's serious on both sides I'm not virt I'm asking a substantive question of who do you assign blame to or do you planed Norm finklestein's conspiracies that the ambulances should have known immediately who was dead that the numbers were changed cuz they were fake or that maybe 51% of the people were killed by uh by Hamas and and Islamic but 49% were killed by I helicopters as me direct question and you got a direct answer I didn't I got majority which could be9 a clear majority what percent is a clear majority as opposed to they live clear majority in my view is well over 50% please don't ask me to be more precise because I you could say 80 90 95 if I knew that I would say it I think it's a reasonable it's a reasonable you're not the best person to be asking that question you know I read when you wrote op described operation defensive shield and you said a few dozen homes were destroyed you're talking about what happened in J refugee camp and you said no the Arab said 500 you guys said 500 Palestinians were killed in and then no but that was the statement of the pan Authority you said a few dozen and there were massacres there a few dozen a few dozen homes well it turned out 140 building buildings were destroyed 5 5,000 people 5,000 people were left homeless how many you 5,000 many you described it no I'm talking about homes destroyed so you're not the best person to be criticizing what Moen says when he says clear majority but he can't say more you know why he can't say more doesn't I he doesn't know yeah yeah I understand that that's a historic if if I was trying to belittle I would give you a very different answer I would just say I don't know I do know you what the right phrase there would be the overwhelming majority were killed by Arab gunmen and very small number were killed by Israelis by accident or whatever probably historian that's probably that may be I I can I can state with confidence a clear majority overwhelming majority you may be correct but I can't state that with certainty I think there's a very easy way to find out is to have a independent forgetting of course you forget forget that doesn't mean anything the law Independent high commission human necessar just repeat all barbaric countries Assyrian was the head of the UN commission for human rights if it wasn't Israeli it would have been okay he certainly would have been more honest than a Oh Yeah from your perspective well to disagree with Stephen I thought this was extremely valuable uh and at times really like the the the view of History the the passion um I'm really grateful that uh you would spend your really valuable time and just one more question since we have uh two historians here well just briefly uh from a history perspective what do you hope your legacy as historians Benny and Norm will be of the work that you've put out there maybe Norm you can go first and try to just say brief I think there's a a value to preserving the record I'm not optimistic about where things are going to end up there was a very nice book written by a woman named Helen Hunt Jackson uh at the end of the 19th century describing what was done to the Native Americans she called it A Century of Dishonor and she described in Vivid uh poignant detail what was done to the Native Americans did it save them no did it help them probably not did it preserve their memory yes and I think there's a value to that you know there was a famous film by eisenstein Sergey eisenstein it was either Battleship with hkin or mother I can't remember which one the last scene was the Zar troops mowing down all the Russian people and he pans the scene not all the Russian people few well he pans the massacre he pans the massacre but he could have killed a lot more and the last words of the movie were proletarians exclamation point remember exclamation point and I've seen it as my life's work to preserve the memory and to remember I didn't expect that anyone would read my book on Gaza it's very dense it gives me even a a bit of a headache to read at least one of the chapters you wrote a book on Gaza and uh but I thought that the memory deserves to be preserved amen well I would just say very briefly unlike my colleague I think writing the truth about what happened in history in various periods of History if I've done a little bit of that I'm happy thank you nor thank you Benny thank you Stephen thank you m thanks for listening to this conversation with Norman fonstein Benny Morris Mo Rani and stevenh benell to support this podcast please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Lyndon B Johnson peace is a journey of a thousand miles and it must be taken one step at a time thank you for listening and hope to see you next time";
